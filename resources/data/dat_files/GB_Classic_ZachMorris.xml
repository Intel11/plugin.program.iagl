These games can be played single player against a computer controlled opponent, two player hot seat style with players passing the Game Boy, or two players with a link cable.ChessThe Sargon Chess splash screen[CR]When starting a game of Chess, players can choose the color of the pieces as well as the desired computer controlled opponents difficulty. The computer player is programmed using the Sargon algorithm and players can choose the difficulty between 1 and 6 with 6 being the most difficult.[CR]The rules are the standard rule set for a basic game of Chess in which players take turns moving their pieces and trying to capture the other players king.Checkers[CR]In Checkers players can choose the color of their pieces as well as the difficulty again, but this time the difficulty maxes out at 3. The rules in Checkers are the same as the classic board game where players take turns moving a checker and trying to jump the opponents checkers to capture them.[CR] BackgammonThe Backgammon splash screen[CR]Once again players can choose to have either white or black pieces and compete against another player or the computer at Backgammon. Like Checkers, Backgammon has only three difficulty levels. Just like all the other games in this compilation, Backgammon plays like a bare bones version of Backgammon.Reversi[CR]Reversi (also known as Othello) is a game in which two players try and get as many of their colored pieces on the board as possible. This game also allows players to choose between black or white pieces and has three difficulty levels.

It is based on the 1992 animated series incarnation of The Addams Family, rather than the movies, live-action TV show or the original comics.[CR]The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt has a somewhat unusual release history; originally released on the SNES, versions for the Game Boy and Nintendo's previous console the NES were published a few months later. It was also made available in Europe several months before the US, as Ocean was a UK-based publisher.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a 2D platformer in which the player controls Pugsley Addams, who must venture forth into his house in search of items hidden by his sister Wednesday.[CR]Certain rooms, such as the bathroom level, are explored with Pugsley haven been shrunk in size. Different characters are also encountered in each of the rooms. For example, the Addams' butler Lurch is found in the Attic stage.[CR]The game is known for its colorful graphics but high difficulty and total lack of a password feature.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 7 out of 10. He wrote, "...another version of the multi-platform game... if you played the SNES version, there is nothing here that is terribly different, except, of course, diminished graphics and sound. This is one of the better games for the NES system".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the password to have the following characters rescued:</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Ocean Software Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<videoid>U0XtYHcrxAE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18274</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585599-the-addams-family-pugsleys-scavenger-hunt</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/addams-family-pugsleys-scavenger-hunt</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-addams-family-pugsleys-scavenger-hunt/3030-14644/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18274-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/156118-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/156119-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/192316-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254339-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22724-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22725-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22726-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22727-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22728-the-addams-family-pugsley-s-scavenger-hunt-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2188105-18.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2188104-17.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2188103-16.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2188102-15.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2188101-14.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Adventure Island (USA, Europe)">		<description>Adventure Island (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="64F4FA44" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAdventure%20Island%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="4A61945C1E3A37301748314777835C0E122A67E6" size="76172" />		<title_clean>Adventure Island</title_clean>		<plot>You just found out that Princess Leilani was kidnapped by the Evil Witch Doctor and taken to Adventure Island in the South Pacific.

The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.[CR]A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 99 of Everything[CR]Enter the password numbers on the password screen for the desired effect.</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft USA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.7</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>3Q5bOSO98NI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3151</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585601-adventure-island-ii-aliens-in-paradise</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/adventure-island-ii-aliens-in-paradise</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/adventure-island-ii/3030-11213/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3151-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3151-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507069-adventure_island_2_0027.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507068-adventure_island_2_0026.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507067-adventure_island_2_0025.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507066-adventure_island_2_0024.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507065-adventure_island_2_0023.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507064-adventure_island_2_0022.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507063-adventure_island_2_0021.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507062-adventure_island_2_0028.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507060-adventure_island_2_0015.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2270/507059-adventure_island_2_0014.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3151-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Adventures of Lolo (Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Adventures of Lolo (Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="176D2EEB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAdventures%20of%20Lolo%20%28Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="E09277358A7FD4F3A6206464DD9D39F3ABE66A53" size="192181" />		<title_clean>Adventures of Lolo</title_clean>		<plot>As Lolo, king of eden land, you have to puzzle your way through numerous screen-sized rooms.

In the game, the duo chase after some familiar-looking thieves who rob the Rocky and Bullwinkle Museum on its opening day. The player can also play basic mini-games featuring Dudley Do-Right, the fearless (and hapless) Canadian Mountie, and Sherman and Mister Peabody, a boy and his dog who regularly travel through time.[CR]The game was developed by Imagineering Inc. released on multiple systems by THQ. The NES and Game Boy versions were created first in late 1992, followed by the SNES and Genesis versions in mid-1993. The characters in the SNES version actually break the fourth wall to remark on the earlier versions and the similar material, displaying the same wry self-referential humor of the series it's based on.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review score of 4 out of 10 writing, "...This is an almost carbon-copy of the NES version, with the poor control intact! Dig the way Rocky attacks with those huge antlers and climbs the side of that mountain! The variety of games is nice, but the whole thing looks rushed".[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>Imagineering Inc</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>eMmlm5G1qRs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18275</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563291-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends/3030-8118/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18275-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/6/21136_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26734-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26735-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26736-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26737-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26739-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26740-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26741-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26742-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26743-the-adventures-of-rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends-game-boy.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2639782-adventures+of+rocky+and+bullwinkle+and+friends%2C+the+%28u%29_00000.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Adventures of Star Saver, The (USA, Europe)">		<description>Adventures of Star Saver, The (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="5D461374" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAdventures%20of%20Star%20Saver%2C%20The%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="408B19A92C73DAA11B3B1A52AA6A987CC6615E97" size="67287" />		<title_clean>Adventures of Star Saver, The</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Adventures of Star Saver is an action game developed by A-Wave and published by both Taito Corporation (US and EU regions) and King Records (Japanese region) for the Game Boy platform.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In The Adventures of Star Saver a brother and sister are both abducted by aliens and forced into helping them invade Earth. When they both refuse to help the aliens the brother and sister are dropped off on different far away planets. The brother gets a mech suit and sets out to save his sister.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in The Adventures of Star Saver consists of both platforming and shooting. Each level in The Adventures of Star Saver requires the player to go from the left side of the screen to the right side. There are some points in the levels in which the player will descend/ascend, but will always still go to the right. At the end of each level there is a boss that must be defeated to move on.ControlsD-Pad - Pressing left or right on the D-Pad will move the playable character in that direction.A Button - Pressing the A button will cause the character to jump, pressing the A button a second time while in the air will use the mech suits thrusters.B Button - The B button is used to shoot projectiles at the enemies, holding the B button will allow the character to run.Start Button - The start button allows the player to pause the game.Select Button - The select button serves to purpose in The Adventures of Star Saver.Power Ups[CR]There are various power ups that can be collected throughout the levels.Gun Power UpGun Power Up[CR]The gun power up is a block with a picture of a hand gun. This power up has two uses, one for when in the mech suit and the other while out of it. While in the mech suit the power up will grant a spread shot while out of the suit it grants rapid fire.Power BlockPower Up Block[CR]The power block is only used if the player has lost the mech suit, otherwise it is only worth points. If the player has lost the mech suit and stands on top of one of these power blocks, a new suit will fall out of it and the player can use it.InvincibilityInvincibility Triangle[CR]The invincibility power up looks like a floating triangle. If the player picks this triangle up they will be invulnerable to any enemies and will defeat the enemy just by touching it. While invincibility is active the players character will blink.ThrusterThruster[CR]The thruster power up looks like a shoe with a wing on it. If the player has acquired this power up and holds the A button while in the air, they will float down more slowly.Lion HeadLion Head Power Up[CR]The lion heads are a secret power up that can only be located by shooting their location first. Once the lions head has been acquired it will grant temporary invincibility much like the triangle. The lion heads power lasts for a longer period of time than the triangle.ArrowsBow and Arrow[CR]The bow and arrow looking power ups are used in the case of falling off of a platform. If the player has fallen off of a platform, instead of instant death the character will automatically use a grappling hook to bring itself back on to the nearest platform.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,5,6 adding, "...this game does have its strong points, including decent graphics and play, it doesn't stand up next to similar efforts like Mega Man have been produced almost flawlessly".[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Taito

Explore the legendary areas of Castlevania, including the surrounding forest and the infamous clock tower. Don't forget to collect hearts from the torches that litter the stages to gain extra lives. Adjustable difficulty settings allow you to choose the skill level at which you want to play. At the end of it all, Count Dracula himself awaits. Can you defeat him and put the evil to rest for another 100 years?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Level[CR]The hidden level is in stage 5. After you beat the first boss, a jumping demon creature, you must go through the doors to get to the next screen. There will be two paths: up and to the right. As the right leads to an empty room, go straight up but stay to the right. There will be an opening in the wall leading to the next screen. This screen will have two bats hanging from the ceiling with a platform below. Below this platform is another smaller platform, which is over the hole in the floor. Jump down this hole. While falling you will see a candle: whip it. After you get the 1-Up candle, you will land on a platform. On this platform will be a white candle: whip this then proceed to get off the platform. Do not exit the room. The floor below will disappear.

One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.[CR]In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.[CR]The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained...".[CR]Danyon Carpenter wrote, "...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation...".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Press the start button and enter the following codes while the screen is paused[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Skip[CR]Press Pause on any level then press A,B(2),A(2),B(2),A</plot>		<releasedate>11/11/1993</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Virgin Interactive Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.1</rating>		<videoid>gfxWysWsFtc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18285</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563265-disneys-aladdin</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/disneys-aladdin</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/disneys-aladdin/3030-19944/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5025</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2361667-nes_disneysaladdin_de.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/18285-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166591-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172919-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172920-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-enemy-you-face.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172921-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-jump-over-the-hot-coals.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172922-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-jumping-on-the-camel.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172923-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-the-lamp-is-a-checkpoint.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172924-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-shimmy-across-the-beams.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172925-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-these-white-platform.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172926-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-look-out-for-people-throwing.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172927-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-these-gems-are-hard-to.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/420467-disney-s-aladdin-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-also-supports.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18285.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Alfred Chicken (USA)">		<description>Alfred Chicken (USA)</description>		<rom crc="3B9C3BC6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAlfred%20Chicken%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="80C39D93CA58D0D6144FE7F7BDD47C3A4FCF0438" size="90179" />		<title_clean>Alfred Chicken</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Alfred Chicken is a 1993 platformer developed by Twilight Games, and published by Mindscape for multiple platforms.

Once all of the balloons have been pecked, a boss is fought to complete the level.[CR]For a publicity stunt to promote the game Karl Fitzhugh, an employee of Mindscape, ran for a political office as the Alfred Chicken party candidate in Christchurch, Dorset, England.

The Aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.[CR]The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Activision</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<videoid>k-RrWpudRwE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18280</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585605-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan/3030-9498/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2475904-avp.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/8/7/22487_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192976-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192977-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192978-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192979-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192980-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192981-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192982-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192983-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192984-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/192985-alien-vs-predator-the-last-of-his-clan-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18280.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="All-Star Baseball 99 (USA)">		<description>All-Star Baseball 99 (USA)</description>		<rom crc="D51EE6D3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAll-Star%20Baseball%2099%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="49D13EEF514D26CEE37B10FF602E21A92B87B69D" size="200534" />		<title_clean>All-Star Baseball 99</title_clean>		<plot>With All-Star Baseball '99, development house Iguana (Turok, NFL Quarterback Club '98) extends its sterling rep for putting great graphics on the N64.

In stadiums with Jumbotrons, the action on the big screen replicates that on the field. The athletes are fully articulated, with nice use of shading that gives them a fully rounded look.

The developer of the game is not known with 100% certainty as the game is credited to both Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.; the latter claiming credit for the game on their corporate website without delving into any further details. The fact that Intelligent Systems is often cited as having spun off from R&amp;D1 adds additional confusion and so it is hard to identify who exactly developed the game without further information being revealed.[CR]Alleyway is referred to as a Block Kuzushi game in its Japanese box art, which isn't so much a franchise of its own than a title applied to any Japanese game that contains Breakout's "ball and paddle" gameplay.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]For players experienced with such games as Breakout and Arkanoid, they will be very familiar with the concept of Alleyway: the player controls a small paddle with the aim of hitting a constellation of bricks with a ball. Each brick disappears once hit with the ball and the goal is to ensure the whole screen is devoid of bricks. Once this is achieved the player then moves onto the next level which becomes that little bit harder to clear. After clearing all of the games 32 stages (24 basic and 8 bonus) the game ends.[CR]Should the ball drops below the paddle the player will lose a life, and once all the lives are gone the player must restart from the beginning. Occasionally, the game will switch to a bonus level in which the ball would not be deflected upon hitting a brick but rather keep charging through, and clearing all the bricks within in the time limit awards a large score boost. Earning enough score eventually increases the player's stock of extra lives, so clearing these bonus stages is often vital.[CR]The game featured Mario who could be seen entering the paddle upon starting a new game, and every time the player lost a life he would appear to jump ship before facing almost certain doom. There were a few other Nintendo subtleties thrown in such as the cameo of certain famous faces each time a bonus stage rolled around.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Faster Bat[CR]Hold A while playing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Faster Bat[CR]Hold B while Playing.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<studio>Nintendo Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<videoid>CLnlPG-kOeM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3152</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585606-alleyway</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/alleyway</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/alleyway/3030-4381/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3152-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3152-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/98952-alleyway-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/68142-alleyway-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111059-alleyway-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172296-alleyway-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/278770-alleyway-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172916-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172907-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-getting-the-ball-up-to-the-top.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172908-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-taking-to-long-makes-the-roof.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172911-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-bonus-level-is-in-the.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172917-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-your-paddle-gets-smaller-as-the.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172913-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-the-second-bonus-is-in-the-shape.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172914-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-a-more-harder-pattern-of-blocks.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172912-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-a-different-pattern-of-blocks.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172915-alleyway-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2628683-alleyway002.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3152-g.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3152.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Altered Space - A 3-D Alien Adventure (USA)">		<description>Altered Space - A 3-D Alien Adventure (USA)</description>		<rom crc="141675D3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAltered%20Space%20-%20A%203-D%20Alien%20Adventure%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="CA586C59B2473A8BEC2F0F37504CB74E3A1E4D11" size="71265" />		<title_clean>Altered Space - A 3-D Alien Adventure</title_clean>		<plot>They never talked about being captured by aliens back in Astronaut School...

Although they share some similarities, the two games are quite different. The SNES version of the game allows for the player to switch between the three characters, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, at will. There are no actual "lives" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to "try and take over the world". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.[CR]The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm ("air kiss") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.[CR]Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and "welcoming" the player to the game).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Cheats[CR]Enter these on the password screen for the desired effect. Grid order from Left-to-Right, top-to-bottom.The password grid will turn blank again if they're entered correctly (with exception to the Level Skip cheat).After entering any of these, either choose "BACK" to go back to the title screen and start the game normally, or enter a proper level password.Note: The "Limited Invincibility" cheat will make you invincible to most hazards except for spikes, bonfires, Pinky &amp; Brain's "vacuum tuba" device in Stage 3, and "Instant Kill" situations.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Cheats[CR]At the password screen, enter these in order from left to right, the going to the next line all the way to the left:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Box Glitch[CR]In Level 2, after the stage with the chandeliers, jump over the fire and you will get to a part where there are two stones and two boxes. Smash the stones with Wakko and pull back one box with Yakko. Now, make sure that the second box is where you it was when you smashed it. If you walk all the way to the right and then back, the other box will disappear! It doesn't hurt the gameplay since you can still do whatever the game asks for with one box. [CR]To get the box back, just walk all the way left and back.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Box Glitch[CR]In the second stage after the chandeliers, there will be a crate. If you push it all the way to the right, then the graphics will start becoming blurry and you won't be able to progress past the boulder lift. The only way to get rid of it is to lose a life or turn off the game. The only harmful effect is losing a life to get rid of it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Stage 4[CR]To unlock Stage 4, beat stages 1-3. After the credits, do to the password screen and there will be a password. Press Start to get Stage 4.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Save your score[CR]To save your score, lose all your lives and say no to the continue screen. After that, you will be given a password in which you can continue your game with however many stages you cleared and the score you had.</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami (America)</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>4gSQxd_mf9c</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>11197</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585612-animaniacs</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/animaniacs</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/animaniacs/3030-3674/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11197-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145367-animaniacs-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22712-animaniacs-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-sgb.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22713-animaniacs-game-boy-screenshot-opening-story.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22714-animaniacs-game-boy-screenshot-warner-studio-lot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22715-animaniacs-game-boy-screenshot-western-set.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22716-animaniacs-game-boy-screenshot-jungle-set-sgb.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2765893-animaniacs001.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2765892-animaniacs+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00010.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2765891-animaniacs+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00009.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2765890-animaniacs+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00008.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2765889-animaniacs+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00007.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11197.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Another Bible (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Another Bible (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="4A486435" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FAnother%20Bible%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="6A5D0DA889247169135665DC91F153305E1C71B6" size="217210" />		<title_clean>Another Bible</title_clean>		<plot>Once upon a time, there was a huge war between the humans and the demons.

You can store those demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided into various races and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical attacks and magic spells.[CR]The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike most other Megaten games (with the exception of  Last Bible series), it is set in a medieval world.</plot>		<releasedate>2/3/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Atlus Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>2.3</rating>		<videoid>1WLXq3sJ6Jc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>29840</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569915-another-bible</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/another-bible</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/another-bible/3030-2439/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10433</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/29840-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/2/3/30523_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60164-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60165-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-battle-area.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60166-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-status-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60167-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-enemy-soldiers.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60168-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-they-all-look-the-same.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60169-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60170-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-die.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/618345-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-typical-fight.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/618346-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-girl-has-trouble.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/618347-another-bible-game-boy-screenshot-kill-him.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/lAaULHn.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Aoki Densetsu Shoot!

Galaxian</title_clean>		<plot>A compilation of two classic arcade titles, Galaga and Galaxian ported over to the Game Boy and features original gameplay features.  It is also Super Game Boy compatible complete with background borders that replicate their original arcade machine casings.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Double-Fire Ship (or 1,000 Points) - Galaga[CR]This trick concerns the Galaga enemies at the top of the screen - they normally only arrive in quantities or four and are the only enemies able to take two hits, switching to blue after the first. One of their attacks - which won't occur if too few (2~5) enemies are left - is to use a tractor beam to get your ship. This initially causes a loss of life, implying this is bad. Actually, this is good - if you shoot down the Galaga that took your ship while it is diving for another attack, then you will be able to recapture that ship and fire two missiles at once, and take two hits before another loss of life. (If you shoot the ship, it gives you a bonus 1,000 points instead. You can shoot the ship at any time. Just note that if you hit the Galaga while it's not actively moving, then the ship will attack you!)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]On most revisions of Galaga, there's a trick that stops enemies from firing at your ship.  In Stage 1, kill all aliens except the two bees in the bottom-left corner.  Allow the bees to dive down and shoot at you, while dodging their shots.  After around 15 minutes or so, the bees will continue to drop down, but they won't fire.  Let them drop down another 5 or 6 times, then kill them.  After all this, enemies will not shoot at you for the rest of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Wait until one of the top ships(the green ones that take two shots to kill) comes down and fires off a tractor beam(the beam that can capture your ship).  Let it capture your ship.  Now, wait until it swoops down again with your ship behind it.  Simply kill the head ship(the green one), and it will lose your ship.  Your ship will then lock on to the side of your current ship, giving you two ships to play with at the same time!  Now, be careful.  Not only will both ships be firing at you after your ship gets captured, but if you accidently shoot your captured ship, you'll destroy it.  Also note, this will cost you one life, but will definately make the Challenging Stages, and perhaps the game itself, a little easier to play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR][B]Note[/B]:  This works in [B]all[/B] non-bootleg/hack versions of [I]Galaga[/I], as well as most of the sequels and Arranged Mode in [I]Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1[/I].</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Namco Limited, Nintendo Co., Nintendo of America Inc., Nintendo of Europe GmbH</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<videoid>56-3BWCIHNA</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18633</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585721-arcade-classic-no-3-galaga-galaxian</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade-classic-no-3-galagagalaxian/3030-42852/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2492460-ac3.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202224-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/184990-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428579-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-game.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428580-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-game.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428581-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428582-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428583-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428584-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428585-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428586-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428587-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428602-arcade-classic-3-galaga-galaxian-game-boy-screenshot-galaga.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18633.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Arcade Classic No. 4 - Defender &amp;

It was designed and programmed by Dominic Walsh and Ed Logg. The aim of the game is to destroy all of the asteroids that drift randomly across the screen, while also avoiding collision with them. Occasional flying saucers, which come in large and small varieties, attempt to impede progress.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Original arcade version.[CR]The objective of Asteroids is to collect as many points as possible by destroying all of the asteroids on screen, and to avoid death (either by collision or being shot by a flying saucer). The ship appears as a small triangle, whose default position is the center of the screen. It can rotate 360 degrees and move forward with the use of thrusters. The ship possesses momentum and will drift for a time after its thrusters are deactivated. At any time, the player may activate a &#8220;hyperspace&#8221; ability, which warps the ship to a random area of the screen (and possibly into the path of an oncoming asteroid).[CR]The asteroids themselves come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. When large asteroids are shot, they break up into two medium asteroids. The same goes for medium asteroids into small, at which point they can be destroyed with a single shot. In addition to asteroids, there are also two types of flying saucers which appear randomly, accompanied by a siren noise. The large type shoots in random directions, while the small type aims at the player. Destroying a saucer will net the player a 1000 point bonus.Atari 2600 version.[CR]The action presented is "wrapped" around the screen along both the horizontal and vertical axis (i.e. if an asteroid drifts off the right side of the screen, it will reappear on the left). The game music consists of a steady &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; sound which increases in tempo as asteroids are destroyed. After all on-screen asteroids have been eliminated, a new round begins and the number of asteroids increases (up to a maximum of 12). The game ends if the player loses all of his/her lives. Due to a programming bug, the game score will roll back to zero after reaching 99,990.[CR]Development[CR]Standing arcade cabinet.[CR]Asteroids was designed around Atari&#8217;s proprietary Digital Vector Generator (DVG), a vector graphics processor that came out of the company&#8217;s off-campus research lab in Grass Valley, California. The DVG was first used by Atari engineer Howard Delman to create the company&#8217;s first vector-based game, Lunar Lander. When it was decided that Asteroids would also utilize a vector display, Delman modified an existing Lunar Lander board and handed it off to Dominic Walsh and Ed Logg.[CR]The Asteroids board is based around a standard MOS 6502 CPU, which executes the game program, and the aforementioned DVG. Extra memory was added, as well as seven distinct audio circuits. The main Asteroids program uses only 6 KB of ROM code, and another 2 KB of vector ROM contains the descriptions of the main graphical elements (asteroids, saucers, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits).[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Asteroids proved to be extremely popular upon its release and, after initially selling over 70,000 units, Atari was forced to ship Asteroids hardware in Lunar Lander cabinets in order to meet the steadily rising demand. In some areas, arcade operators installed larger cash boxes onto their Asteroids cabinets to keep up with the high player traffic. The success of Asteroids prompted Atari to continue iterating on its vector technology; a color display was developed soon after, used in such games as Tempest and Major Havoc.Blasteroids, one of several arcade sequels.[CR]Asteroids was subsequently ported to most of Atari&#8217;s home consoles, including the 2600, 7800 and Lynx. A 5200 version was planned and advertised, but was never actually released. The 7800 version is notable for featuring co-operative play, and was included as a built-in game for the console&#8217;s European release. A sequel was released in 1981, dubbed Asteroids Deluxe, that included blue-tinted graphics, a shield ability (in place of a hyperspace jump), rotating asteroids, and new &#8220;killer satellite&#8221; enemies. Two more arcade sequels followed, with Space Duel arriving in 1982 and Blasteroids in 1987.[CR]Many games have either borrowed some of Asteroids basic mechanics, or cloned its gameplay outright. Included in the former category are Williams&#8217; Sinistar, which has players shoot asteroids in order to collect resources, and Mine Storm, the built-in game for the failed Vectrex system. In the latter group are Acornsoft's Meteors and Ambrosia Software's Maelstrom, as well as Asterax, Astrogeddon, Stardust, Spheres of Chaos and Astro Fire.[CR]In the last few decades, Asteroids has been included in a number of arcade compilations, including the Windows 3.1 Microsoft Arcade packages, Atari Anniversary Edition (2001, Dreamcast and PC), and Atari Anthology (2004, Xbox and Playstation 2).

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] In the single player game of Atomic Punk there are two different modes, A and B. In Game A mode there is a world map which contains nine different sections of play. Any of these sections can be chosen in any order. Coins are earned through finishing the sections, the amount is dependent on the speed finishing the level and the amount of destructible blocks that were destroyed. Coins can be used to buy various panels (or power ups) that can be used at the start of a section.    In the Game B mode the gameplay is classic  Bomberman style of merely trying to bomb the other players, no coins or world map are in this mode.  There is also a 2 player versus modes in Atomic Punk. The first of these modes is called Panel Mode. In Panel Mode each player starts at the basic fire power and a single bomb at a time, but various power ups will randomly appear on the play field that can increase the fire power or amount of bombs. The other mode, called Powerful Mode, both players start with being able to plant four bombs at a time and the fire power is at maximum. In Powerful Mode no power ups will appear on the play field.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]Enter these codes at the Password screen[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]To go to Stage 50, enter the password: [B]B 0 M N D P B L 3 N C B 3 L 2 H 2 D J J[/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]Enter "QQ88Q8Q7" at the Bomber Boy password screen to see the ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] More money[CR]Get the password for a game and then change the first letter to an X.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] More money[CR]Intentionally lose a ''B'' mode game and receive the password.

You grab your skateboard and follow him to set her free. But the way to the castle is filled with obstacles and creatures who Sethron has turned to the path of evil.[CR]Baby T-Rex is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 "worlds", each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The game play is fast paced, with slides and skateboards passages for added speed. You can find stones and bowling balls to throw at the enemies. There are also power-ups to replenish health, obtain extra lives and gain invincibility.[CR]The game was used as a base for two other games, We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story and Bamse. Only vital elements such as the main character sprites and background story were changed, otherwise the games are identical.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Laser Beam Entertainment Pty.

/>		<title_clean>Balloon Kid</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Balloon Kid is a sequel to Balloon Fight (NES) for the original Game Boy. The game unlike it&#8217;s predecessor has a plot and 3 characters. Each one of them has it&#8217;s own personality. You fly on your balloons through different locations like an ocean, mountains, industrial building or a town called Pencilvania which is filled with skyscrapers shaped like pencils.[CR]Balloon Kid was developed by Pax Softonica and published by Nintendo in 1990 on Game Boy.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Alice &#8211; The main character of the game. You control her as player 1 in all of the modes and you have to save your brother Jim from trouble.[CR]Samm &#8211; Your eternal rival. Player 2 controls him.[CR]Jim &#8211; Your brother. He accidentally flew away on some balloons when he trying to make a balloon rainbow in the sky. Jim leaves a trail of balloons for Alice to follow and collect.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Balloon Kid's gameplay can best be compared to a blend of the underwater stages of Super Mario and modern day helicopter flash games. The player was allowed to move back and forth throughout the level but the screen would automatically move from right to left, forcing the player to keep moving constantly. The player starts each stage with 2 balloons and can starting floating by repeatedly pressing A or B. If the balloons are popped by enemies or hazards, players will fall to their death unless they find a safe platform. Players are also allowed to purposely let go of balloons to accomplish different tasks. If the players find themselves on a platform with no balloons to float with, they can always tap down repeatedly to pump more air into their balloons. In some cases, the player is only given enough time to completely fill one balloon before having to advance.[CR]Most enemies and hazards come directly from Balloon Fight (NES). Birds, fire, spikes, fish (as depicted on box art), and lightning are just some of the things that block your path. There are also 4 boss fights in the game. Defeating enemies and bosses is done by head jumping. This could be accomplished by releasing your balloons and dropping onto an enemy or simply jumping while on a platform.[CR]Part of Samm's plan to keep Alice following the right path to save him is to leave a trail of balloons. These balloons serve as the game's collectibles. Once 100 balloons are collected, an extra life is given.

The game was exclusively created for the Swedish market.[CR]The story goes, that Skalman has invented a time machine and together with Bamse and Lille Skutt they travel 75 million years back in time to the age of the dinosaurs. But the mischievous Vargen sneaks along and kidnaps Skalman to his "doomed castle". Bamse must now free his friend so they can get back to their own time again.[CR]Bamse is not an original game. Instead it is a re-skinned version of  Baby T-Rex by the same developer. This explains why the settings of the game appears out of context with very little to do with the original cartoon. It also suffers from translation errors and contain left overs from the original game which do not fit in.[CR]It is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 "worlds", each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The gameplay is fast paced, with slides and skateboards for added speed. You can find small jars of "Dunderhonung" and bowling balls to throw at the enemies. There are also power-ups to replenish health and obtain extra lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various Cheats[CR]Each cheat is to be entered on the Title Screen.

She can pick up bouncing stars which, when thrown, will freeze them in place for a few seconds, or occasionally pick up a "B" logo which will knock them out of the level completely.

The game was a launch title for both respective systems in the US, first on the NES in 1985 (the Japanese Famicom version was released in late 1983, a few months after the system's debut) and subsequently on the Game Boy in 1989 (it was also a launch title in Japan).[CR]It is notable for being one of the first Game Boy games to be configured for use with the Game Link Cable, which allowed for multiplayer gameplay between two Game Boy units.[CR]Game Boy[CR]Game Boy Box Art[CR]The Game Boy version of "Baseball" was one of the first games available for Nintendo's handheld. It includes Mario and Luigi as captains. Mario himself is featured on the cover.[CR]Mario and Luigi are captains of the team; Mario is the captain of the Bears; Luigi is the captain of the Eagles. The player can select them as their pitcher if they wanted, but graphically all the pitchers look the same. The rest of the team pitchers have common English names, such as "Paul","Randy","Sam", and "Jimmy."[CR]During this era, Nintendo would often include Mario in games just for appearances' sake to help sell the game, though often it wasn't really possible to control Mario in many of these games.

The game came in a pack much like a pack of baseball cards. There were a total of 5 cards that had to be scanned by the e-reader in the correct order. On the back of each card provided screenshots of the game as well as tips and instructions.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.0</rating>		<videoid>mAHBKrjBJ-I</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3153</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/196698-baseball</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/baseball</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/baseball/3030-8145/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3153-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3153-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/27209-baseball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111529-baseball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161277-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161281-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-select-usa-or-japan-mode.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161282-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-select-your-starters.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161283-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-play-ball.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161284-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-i-m-pitching.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161285-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-he-hit-a-high-foul.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161286-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-i-caught-it-and-he-is-out.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161287-baseball-game-boy-screenshot-i-m-at-bat.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2785006-baseball001.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/132099/2191714-gbbaseball_gameover.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3153-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Baseball Kids (Japan)">		<description>Baseball Kids (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="A503CB07" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBaseball%20Kids%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E4A49A9ECD7A9CE8BB552981E90903F21C741428" size="52555" />		<title_clean>Baseball Kids</title_clean>		<plot>Pitch, hit and run like the pros!

The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.[CR]Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. [CR]Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.[CR]Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. [CR]This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Sun Corporation of America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.7</rating>		<videoid>YXiFFiXPURw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18298</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/574707-batman-return-of-the-joker</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/batman-return-of-the-joker</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-return-of-the-joker/3030-12879/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13064</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18298-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77995-batman-return-of-the-joker-nes-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/43405-batman-return-of-the-joker-nes-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/232900-batman-return-of-the-joker-nes-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/69423-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101917-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-baddies-jump.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101918-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-the-hero.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101919-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101920-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-starting-level.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101921-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-let-s-get-rid.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101922-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-careful-big.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101923-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-batman-is-riding.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101924-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-starting-a-level.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101925-batman-return-of-the-joker-genesis-screenshot-before-a-boss.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/YMBtQNe.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Batman - The Animated Series (USA, Europe)">		<description>Batman - The Animated Series (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="C8E578BF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBatman%20-%20The%20Animated%20Series%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="4A8C1DD74B1279C0DC85AC2BEBB5DB2795CB67B0" size="97692" />		<title_clean>Batman - The Animated Series</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman: The Animated Series is based on the 90's television show of the same name.

While the game features cut scenes derived from the film itself, many of the elements are taken from the comic book, such as boss fights. On the other hand, there are plenty of elements that are completely created for the video game such as the many mechanical enemies Batman faces off with. The video game saw much critical acclaim as being a quality title based off of a popular license, something that is still hard to find to this day.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The player uses the standard D-Pad controls to move Batman around from left to right whereas down makes Batman duck, a very useful ability when fighting enemies with projectiles. The B button is used to punch, Batman's most useful ability, or use his equipped weapon. The A button is used to jump and Batman does a lot of it in this game. Batman will often times use the wall jump ability to bypass many of the platforming elements within the game or to find hidden shortcuts around powerful enemies. Strangely enough, the Start Button allows Batman to switch weapons whereas the Select Button pauses the game.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Fisticuffs - Batman's primary default attack is punching, which turns out to be rather helpful. In fact, it's Batman's most useful attack. It conserves ammo, it destroys most enemies in only a few hits if less, and it stays true to his martial roots. Batman would go on to punch goons throughout video games.[CR]Batarang - Batman's boomerang weapon consumes one unit of ammo per shot but would hit enemies multiple times. This is the weapon Batman should use when trying to hit enemies from a limited range but too far to punch in the face.[CR]Spear Gun - This gun shoots spears! This trademark Batman weapon fires projectiles that can hit an enemy across the screen and consumes two units of ammo. Useful when trying to kill an enemy standing on a platform that Batman is jumping to with no room to punch it.[CR]Dirk - This special, powerful attack forms three discs that shoot towards an enemy. While it has limited range, the attack is useful against enemies that are proving a nuisance from a step below. The attack uses three units of ammo per shot, but is meant to be used sparingly.[CR]Power Ups[CR]Bonus Item - Gives Batman 1000 points. Even in 1990, points were still relevant.[CR]Pellet Item - Gives Batman 10 units of ammo, used in all of his weapons.[CR]Heart Item - Fills up one of Batman's eight hit points.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Shakedown and Maxiezeus (Standard Goon) - The very first enemy Batman faces is the standard, suicidal henchman who runs up to the caped crusader, dying instantly against a pummeling fist from Bats. The standard fodder that will appear at least once per stage.[CR]Mobile Tracker (Spike Bot) - A little robot that skims across the ground quickly when in sight of Batman. Two spikes alternate on top of its frame, threatening to stab Batman's tender little feet if he were to land on it after attempting to jump over.[CR]Heatwave (Flamethrower Goon) - This stationary henchman kneels down while firing his flamethrower every few moments. The orange cone eventually shuts off, allowing Batman to swoop in and land a few punches into his face. One of the primary enemies in the game, meant to challenge the player through difficult wall jumping elements.[CR]Deadshot (Gun Goon) - Another stationary henchman who would rather stand still while shooting every once in a while at the Batman. Easy enough to evade and rather weak in combat. These goons don't show up very often in the game.[CR]Mobile Home Mine (Mine Bot) - A little mine that skitters across the ground within the proximity of Batman. Easy enough to evade and never truly becomes a threat.[CR]The Enforcer (Jetpack Goon) - A rare enemy that only shows up in the first stage, firing his machine gun at Batman while flying above him in his jetpack. A few well-placed batarangs can make short work of him.[CR]K.G.Beast (Ninja) - Only one appearance throughout the entire game within the first stage and he is a total let down. Batman can easily dispatch this ninja by walking up to his side and throwing a few batarangs at him before he even notices Batman's presence.[CR]Nightslayer (Claw Goon) - Introduced in the second stage, these guys are slow moving henchmen equipped with massive claws on their hand. Powerful and hard to evade, but swift to dispatch.[CR]Javelin (Drill Bot) - Introduced in the second stage, this stationary robot extends its javelin-like head in a pattern of thrusts. Play more of a challenging role in wall jumping areas, but is otherwise easy to dispatch.[CR]Drop Claw - Also introduced in the second stage is a ceiling-mounted dispenser of claw bots, little claws that run along the ground to harm the Batman.[CR]Jader (Mutant Goon) - Batman runs across these biological weapons in the third stage. They are very hard to evade as their large bodies jump around swiftly as they try to attack Batman. There are not many of them around, but they do make platforming elements much more difficult.[CR]EEV (Tank Goon) - Introduced in the caverns of stage three, this goon-controlled mini-tank shoots powerful projectiles at Batman.[CR]Rail Runner (Rail Bot) - This robot makes a brief appearance through stage four. Moving on a horizontal rail, it moves left to right trying to bash Batman.[CR]Locations[CR]Stage 1[CR]Gotham CityKiller Moth[CR]This stage is split up between three sub-stages. In Main Street (1-1), Batman fights off standard goons and spike bots. In the first area, Batman passes by a Don't Walk sign post and a Theater (presumably the same theater outside of which his parents were gunned down) twice in an unfortunate sign of recycled content. In High-Rise Buildings (1-2), Batman is forced to practice his wall jump abilities, one of the trademark abilities within the video game. This is the stage in which players pit Batman against jetpack goons and a very laid back ninja.[CR]The Front of City Hall (1-3) is Batman's first boss fight, Killer Moth. Ripped straight from the comics, Killer Moth fires up the jetpack within his metallic "wings" and flies around from side to side, swooping down to ram Batman. Killer Moth will also fire several blue firebolts across the screen from above. In the cutscene proceeding the boss' defeat, Batman hops into the batmobile and blasts through a metal door, blowing open a path to drive through.Stage 2[CR]Axis Chemical FactoryGluk[CR]The second stage is split up into four sub-stages. In the Liquid Waste Floor sub-stage (2-1), Batman encounters claw goons and his first true platforming challenge, jumping across small platforms suspended above a massive vat of toxic chemicals (Gluk) while the green sludge also drips from above. In the Spark Floor sub-stage (2-2), Batman faces even more platforming challenges against deadly high voltage wires and drill bots, including plenty of wall jumping. The Conveyer-Belt Floor (2-3) introduces the claw bots, which yield plenty of power-ups upon the simple, continuous defeats. Unfortunately for Batman, this also marks the appearance of moving treads, guiding Batman towards deadly spinning blades while he fights off more flamethrower and gun goons.[CR]In the Nerve Center (2-4), Batman is locked in with the Machine Intelligence System, forming a three-part boss fight. The first section is straight across from where Batman starts out, firing two projectiles in rapid succession. After the wall-mounted turrets are destroyed, the second section is accessed just above. The electric current controller across from Batman is protected by four ceiling-mounted chemical dispensers dripping onto a moving tread. After the orb is destroyed, the high voltage wire guarding the Nerve Center blows up, revealing a larger glowing orb that shifts into a three-way spread turret before shifting back into the weak point. Batman swiftly destroys the blue glowing orb before cutting to the next scene, showing Joker with a pistol, speaking his catchphrase "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? Ha ha ha. . . . . ." before firing his gun.Stage 3[CR]Underground ConduitElectrocutioner[CR]In Underground Conduit I (3-1), Batman immediately faces off against the mutant goon for the first time. Blue water flows down, making the scene similar to a sewer level, popular among st comic book games. There are more platforming and wall jumping elements that test Batman here, but also throw in deadly grinding fans within the waist-deep water. In Underground Conduit II (3-2), the scenery is immediately changed as the water becomes a bright green. While wading through the viscus sewer water, Batman fights off against more Heatwaves and spike bots. After a brief wall-jumping section, Batman climbs up to the Underground Cavern (3-3). This large, cavernous area introduces the goon-driven tank, the EEV. After facing off with those, Batman faces a more difficult challenge in strategically placed flamethrower goons and mine bots as he wall jumps across more grinding fans whilst scaling the caverns. Perhaps the introduction of vertical combat?[CR]Stage 3-4. Defeat the Electrocutioner. Taken straight from the DC comic, Electrocutioner is equipped with a massive claw on his left hand while his right hand is replaced with a massive 10 Mega-Giga volt beam called the Moon Attacker. This sword-like beam creates a devistating attack that fills the bottom half of the screen with a large electric arc and jumps back and forth from left to right. After this monstrousity is destroyed, the Joker shows up again.[CR]Joker: "Welcome, Batman, why don't you look at my latest work of art?"Stage 4[CR]Laboratory RuinsHe Recorded Over CSI.[CR]In the Research Laboratory (4-1), Batman starts out in a futuristic backdrop where flashing conduits are seen against the metallic floors. While traversing the lab, Batman is attacked by se veral mechanical enemies and the mutant Jader creatures. In the foreground, there are strange cylinders filled with green liquid and three television screens with the Joker's laughing face broadcasting. The Storage Room (4-2) is marked by the Joker's trademark greens and purples. Batman starts out platform jumping over several grinding gears from below. Soon, the same gears are cranking from all sides.[CR]Once Batman enters the Thermal Processing Plant (4-3), Batman starts out across from the Exit door he must reach, but the jump is too far. In this area, he jumps down several floors evading the dangerous track bots and live circuits. There's also a large pool of flames that Batman must avoid at all cost. Part of the laboratory here is starting to deteriorate. Eventually, Batman comes to several tiny moving treads that he must use to platform and wall jump while evading Mobile Units and live circuits. Finally, he accends the stairs, fighting off several enemies to reach the Exit door.[CR]The Dual-Container Alarm (4-4) are two large cubes that move opposite each other across the room's walls. Both of these containers fire projectiles at Batman to the left and to the right. These containers are very slow moving and can be evaded easily if Batman fights in the proper area. After the first container is destroyed, the remaining cube enters a state of emergency, opening from the top and erupting with several fire bombs. These six projectiles move across the screen and can be hard to avoid as the container skims across the bottom of the room.[CR]After the boss is defeated, Batman hops into his Batwing and flies towards the Cathedral where the Joker has escaped to.Stage 5[CR]Gotham City CathedralFirebug.[CR]When Batman enters the Stairway (5-1), he's immediately faced with more grinding gears and more flamethrower goons. After scaling the stairway, Batman then begins to scale the Belltower itself. This involves an epic wall jump scenario wherein Batman must avoid several javelin bots, grinding gears, flamethrowers, Mobile Units and Drop Claws. Perhaps this was the implimentation of today's Vertical Combat concept?[CR]Batman is thrust immediately into a boss fight (5-2) against Firebug. Working as Joker's bodyguard, Firebug wants revenge against the Batman for defeating his brother. This horned villain from the comic books conjures six-hundred million degree fireballs, tossing them at Batman while he jumps around the stage rapidly. Firebug is easy enough to defeat, but leads into the final battle with The Joker.[CR]Joker: "Greetings Batbrain - Are you ready to meet your destiny?"The Joker.[CR]The final confrontation (5-3) pits Batman against The Joker himself. Wearing the trademark purple suit and green hair, The Joker fires powerful bullets from the massive, long pistol he uses in the film before, of course, summoning three lightning bolts. They have to make a boss fight against a mastermind like The Joker more interesting, right? After a tough, strategic battle, Batman knocks The Joker out. He tries to stand, but only manages to fall back down in defeat. Cue the next cutscene.[CR]Batman: "I know you murdered my parents. Now you will dance with the devil in the pale moonlight."[CR]Then throws him off the very top of the belltower. We see The Joker fall from the belltower then a shot of his body alone, underneath a streetlamp before a close up on his smiling face fades to black. Roll credits.[CR]Release[CR]While Batman: The Video Game was ported to numerous systems (including the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive - which is often considered the best version of the game), the NES and Game Boy versions were the only versions released in North America. This was because of Nintendo's strict policies for third-party publishers during the this era. In addition to limiting the number of games a publisher could release per year and heavily moderating the level of questionable content allowed in these games, Nintendo also demanded console exclusivity for released games; a game released on their system was not allowed to be released on a competitor's system. Many publishers got around this by exploiting a loophole that allowed them to license their properties to competing companies to create their own ports of the games (which is why games such as Ninja Gaiden, R-Type and Double Dragon were able to appear on Sega's competing 8-bit system, the Master System - Sega was granted the licenses for these properties and developed these versions themselves), but Batman was already ported and reprogrammed for a Genesis release. With no way to release the game for both systems in North America, Sunsoft chose to release the NES version, most likely because of the system's continued success and install base (the Genesis was not even a year old at the time of Batman's release). However, Mega Drive versions were released in Europe and Japan where Nintendo had no such third-party policies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR] Press Up/Right and press Start at the title screen.</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>SunSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>XVz8ZICmjCw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>11199</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/196709-batman-the-video-game</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/batman-the-video-game</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-the-video-game/3030-21264/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/11238</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11199-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/oe5a9NS.png</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213046-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101672-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/279398-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19117-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19118-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-in-the-batcave.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19119-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-gotham-city.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19120-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-chemical-factory.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19121-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-the-joker.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623875-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-batman-sign.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623876-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-bricks.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623877-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-edge.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623878-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-classical-platform.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623879-batman-the-video-game-game-boy-screenshot-little-black-thing.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/HlJ8CCn.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Batman Forever (USA, Europe)">		<description>Batman Forever (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="EF3592CC" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBatman%20Forever%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="CB76B6D3EC9903A734F70FF11195F40F13F4D83F" size="149625" />		<title_clean>Batman Forever</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman Forever is a 2D beat 'em up developed by Acclaim London and published by Acclaim for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1995. Loosely based on the 1995 film of the same name, up to two players team up as either Batman or his sidekick Robin as they set out to foil the plans of criminal Two-Face and puzzler The Riddler. Unlike traditional beat 'em up games, Batman Forever combines 2D platforming with fighting game controls (in similar vein to Mortal Kombat). The game features a non-linear level structure (with puzzles) and fully-digitized actors.[CR]The game was ported to the Game Gear, Game Boy, and PC by Probe. Another Acclaim-published beat 'em up based on the same movie was released for arcades in 1996 under the same name. Also sporting fully-digitized actors, it was later released for the PlayStation and Saturn as Batman Forever: The Arcade Game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can choose between playing as the Caped Crusader or his sidekick, Robin or can even add a second controller for co-operative play.[CR]The fighting aspect of the game resembles the engine for the "Mortal Kombat" games, right down to the motion-captured characters and the basic fighting moves (uppercut, high and low punch, etc).[CR]Players can also choose what gadgets to bring along in each level, which each gadget having it's own pro's and cons. Arguably, the most useful gadget is the grappling hook, which gets the character to higher parts of the level that couldn't be reached before.[CR]The game includes many secrets, such as different hidden gadgets and multiple "riddles" from The Riddler himself.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]While on the Difficulty Select Screen, press [B] Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Right [/B].[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the Difficulty Selection screen, press Down, Down, Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>2.0</rating>		<videoid>A_W7GvEJ-04</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18297</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585617-batman-forever</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/batman-forever</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-forever/3030-10020/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18297-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/170020-batman-forever-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/170021-batman-forever-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21634-batman-forever-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21635-batman-forever-game-boy-screenshot-upercut-to-giggles.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21636-batman-forever-game-boy-screenshot-swing-from-the-trapeze.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21637-batman-forever-game-boy-screenshot-train-station-fight.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21638-batman-forever-game-boy-screenshot-elevator-fight.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/15/155745/2178274-image_037.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/15/155745/2178272-image_036.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/15/155745/2178271-image_035.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/15/155745/2178270-image_034.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/15/155745/2178268-image_033.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Battle Arena Toshinden (USA) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Battle Arena Toshinden (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="2D0C1073" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBattle%20Arena%20Toshinden%20%28USA%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="9C337D3F56938AA46CFC8B85C0DB4631BCBE217C" size="307107" />		<title_clean>Battle Arena Toshinden</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Arena Toshinden has been credited as the first polygonal 3D weapon-based fighting game. It is also the first 3D fighting game to fully incorporate the side-step, a concept which has become a critical move in many later fighting games. Battle Arena Toshinden was a sleeper hit, and, at the system's launch, the premier fighting game for the PlayStation. Despite the quality of the graphics, Battle Arena Toshinden was fairly well received at the time.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the Toushindaibukai, the ultimate tournament held once a year by the mysterious organization Himitsu Kessha, the greatest fighters in the world gather year after year to pit their abilities against one another. This tournament is no mere competition. To the winner goes unimaginable rewards, and the losers only know the defeat of death. It is here that these fighters will decide their own futures, in the Battle Arena Toshinden.[CR]Ports[CR]The PC port, released in early 1996, was notable for being one of the first PC games to support 3D graphics accelerator cards, if not the very first. It was released with support for Creative Labs' 3D Blaster and NVIDIA's NV1 graphics cards. While the PC port looked superior to the later Sega Saturn version, it was unable to rival the PlayStation original, at least not until more powerful graphics cards like the NEC PowerVR and 3dfx Voodoo came along.Gameboy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of Battle Arena Toshinden was released in 1996. It includes all the characters from the PS release as well as an extra character, named Uranus.[CR]The game plays a lot like the original version, but on a 2D plane and using a simplified 2 button system. There are special moves for each character, as well as an unlockable "Jet Mode" (available after entering a code) that speeds up gameplay.[CR]During the main mode, each character is introduced in a single picture with some text describing their story.[CR]PlayStation Launch Game[CR]Battle Arena Toshinden was a North American launch game for the original PlayStation back in 1995.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.1</rating>		<videoid>a8pxUyuwrW4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>17776</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585620-battle-arena-toshinden</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/battle-arena-toshinden_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/battle-arena-toshinden/3030-5238/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10658</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1814618-box_bat.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207048-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207049-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/88936-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60208-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460054-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60209-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-player-select.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60210-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-somebody-help-her.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60211-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-let-s-fight.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60212-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-kick-him.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60213-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-that-hurts.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60215-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-revenge.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/420468-battle-arena-toshinden-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-also-supports.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2593/384249-tsd_001.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/lHlTD7l.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Battle Bull (USA)">		<description>Battle Bull (USA)</description>		<rom crc="D4D1AEA2" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBattle%20Bull%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="A553B2CF2A5D223B6AC8ACA4E9FD65B65087A1F4" size="53457" />		<title_clean>Battle Bull</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Bull is an action/puzzle game that charges the player with taking control of a mining robot to destroy a number of renegade robots after a virus wreaks havoc on the deep space mining operation Perseus VI causing them to go BERSERK.

Similarly to Technos's Super Dodge Ball, each combatant has a health meter which depletes whenever they are hit by the dodgeball. Stronger throws cause more damage and once a character's HP is depleted, they leave the arena.[CR]Teams have three members apiece, with an additional group of three identical "minor" characters that sit outside of the opponent's area and can try and hit them with any balls that leave their side of the court. During the single player mode the player can spend experience points they earn in matches to level up their characters' abilities, including the group of minor characters.[CR]The game is Banpresto's second SNES entry in the Compati Hero crossover franchise (the first being SD Great Battle), which frequently sets up battles between characters of the three franchises above. Battle Dodge Ball would eventually be followed with a sequel, Battle Dodge Ball II.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>16/10/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Sun L</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569763-battle-dodge-ball</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/battle-dodge-ball/3030-38107/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2187287-battle_dodgeball.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2187291-battle_dodgeball___back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2687962-battledodgeball001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545748-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29006.png</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545747-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29005.png</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545746-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29004.png</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545745-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29003.png</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545744-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29002.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545743-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29001.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2545742-battle+dodgeball+%28j%29000.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/9/2/gfs_7589_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/4/2/gfs_7589_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Battle of Kingdom (Japan)">		<description>Battle of Kingdom (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="35914DEB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBattle%20of%20Kingdom%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="5761F47A09F91A373BDA96840FE2560BFF1FFC97" size="73301" />		<title_clean>Battle of Kingdom</title_clean>		<plot>Battle of Kingdom is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Lenar and published by Meldac,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>13/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Board Game</genre>		<studio>Lenar</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569694-battle-of-kingdom</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/battle-of-kingdom/3030-34436/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731238-bok.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731239-bokback.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731243-bok5.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731242-bok4.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731241-bok3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1731240-bok2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/2/gfs_8058_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/8/2/gfs_8058_1_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/3/2/gfs_8058_1_3.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/2/2/gfs_8058_1_4.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/2/gfs_8058_1_5.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/2/gfs_8058_1_6.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Battle of Olympus, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)">		<description>Battle of Olympus, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</description>		<rom crc="CA450E93" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBattle%20of%20Olympus%2C%20The%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29.zip" sha1="C0CA1948C4BFCA795A29CE82AA5AB9215B9ED601" size="166518" />		<title_clean>Battle of Olympus, The</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Battle of Olympus is a side-scrolling action adventure game with a similar style to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The game begins with an overworld map displaying the eight locations Orpheus can visit: Phrygia, Phthia, Attica, Argolis, Peloponnes, Laconia, Crete, and the starting area, Arcadia. The player cannot use the map to choose the next location, it is only there to display the current location.Layout[CR]The layout of the world is similar to Metroid, where there are no set levels, just areas which are all connected together.[CR]Towns are also set up similar to Zelda II, in that entering a house will allow the player to talk to NPCs will provide, occasionally cryptic, advice. There is no separation between towns and places where enemies can be fought: Each area contains both.Combat[CR]Fighting enemies can result in item drops such as olives, which are used as currency in shops, and bay leaves, which are used to restore health. Some bosses will drop items needed to progress further in the game as well.[CR]Another important task is to seek out the gods who will give Orpheus crucial upgrades.[CR]Completing certain tasks will allow Orpheus to enter new areas that were inaccessible before.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story takes place in Ancient Greece. Orpheus, the hero, discovers the truth behind the death of his love Helene, who was supposedly poisoned but was really kidnapped by Hades, the god of the underworld. Upon hearing this, Orpheus sets out to save her with the gods assisting him.[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]There was a Game Boy version of the game released only in Europe in 1993. It was developed by Radical Entertainment. The Game Boy port of the game is very similar to the NES version, changing the graphics to fit the Game Boy system.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New Game Passwords[CR]...Enter these passwords at the

The game offers semi-destructible environments - the brick walls that make up most of the levels can be destroyed completely allowing you to cut a path to your target. Other non-destructible obstacles such as water (cannot be crossed) and foliage (hiding both your and enemy tanks from view) make up the rest of the environment.This game can be played 2-player, co-operatively.Enemies come in waves, and can range from enemy tanks that can be destroyed in one shot to armoured behemoths that take more than several shots to destroy. The game has no boss battles. The player can completes a level by destroying all 20 enemy tanks on the level or loses the level if they run out of lives, or if an eagle statue (i.e. your base) at the bottom of the map is destroyed by the enemy.To help defeat the enemy, several temporary powerups can be picked up after destroying foes. These range from invincibility for your tank, invincibility for your statue to extra lives.Finally, the game also offers a level creator. However any levels created cannot be saved.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Button Codes[CR]Enter at the title screen to activate the corresponding effect.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]When you start a new game and the screen tells you that you're on level 1, press [B]UP[/B] to reach the desired level number.

The game begins aboard the space ship &#8216;The Vulture&#8217; where Battletoads Rash, Zitz, and Pimple (all disgustingly named after skin diseases) are escorting Princess Angelica back to her home planet. Pimple and Princess Angelica go cruisin&#8217; and get intercepted by the game&#8217;s villain, the Dark Queen of Ragnarok. Both are kidnapped and taken back to Ragnarok. The Professor (captain of The Vulture) takes Rash and Zitz to &#8216;rumble&#8217; with the Dark Queen on Ragnarok and &#8216;get the Princess and Pimple back.&#8217; The remainder of the game takes place on planet Ragnarok where Rash and Zitz set off to save their friend Pimple and Princess Angelica.Gameplay[CR]While the first level is a typical 2d beat em up similar to Double Dragon, other levels have a variety of gameplay styles, including rappelling down a pit, riding speed bikes and surfboards, navigating a level on a unicycle-like vehicle that can ride up walls and on the ceiling, etc. The main objective of each level is to defeat as many enemies and overcome as many obstacles as possible and reach the endpoint. General strategy is to memorize these obstacles[CR]and rely on quick reflexes to reach the end. The entire game rounds up to two difficult levels where you climb a tower and, at the end, reach the Dark Queen.[CR]The most memorable aspect of this game is the absurd difficulty. Not only did it employ a decent amount of memorization but reflexes had to be fast, even for veteran gamers. Another memorable moment for this game would be the humorous way enemies were finished off, be it by using a football helmet or sprouting horns and ramming the enemy off screen.[CR]When the game was released on the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it the scores of 8,8,8,7 saying, "...one of the best Game Boy games I've ever played". The Game Boy version had the same basic theme found in the NES adventure, with the toads using all of the same fighting moves. The levels and bosses however were entirely original.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Tradewest</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.7</rating>		<videoid>TGJ8LEatY-I</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13061</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585623-battletoads</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/battletoads_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/battletoads/3030-21228/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13061-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/42822-battletoads-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253275-battletoads-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/96590-battletoads-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/30887-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460454-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-the-dark-queen-is-insulting.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460455-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-the-professor-wants-us-to.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/30889-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-first-level.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460457-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-what-are-these-ugly-fellows.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460458-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-portrait-of-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460459-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-guess-what-this-arm-will-do.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460460-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-boss-in-action.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/30890-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-second-level.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460461-battletoads-game-boy-screenshot-the-second-boss-a-rat-in-a.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Battletoads in Ragnarok's World (Europe)">		<description>Battletoads in Ragnarok's World (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="7FFC34EA" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBattletoads%20in%20Ragnarok%27s%20World%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="1852BD23644E28109B66FA937053C689A63F7729" size="107906" />		<title_clean>Battletoads in Ragnarok's World</title_clean>		<plot>The Dark Queen has returned, this time kidnapping your best friend and the best looking girl in the galaxy.

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is similar to other 2D fighting games, with two characters combining kicks and punches to wear down the opponent's health, displayed as a series of 'lights' above the ring. Players are able to customize their fighter by choosing their appearance, as well as which techniques to include in the character's move set, with the majority of the techniques being accurate kickboxing, Muay Thai and Tae-Kwon-Do moves. Players are also able to train a fighter, with practice sparring and pad drills increasing the speed and strength of the fighter.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Sports</genre>		<studio>Electro Brain Corp.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>cspquDS8kX4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18304</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585629-best-of-the-best-championship-karate</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/best-of-the-best-championship-karate</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/best-of-the-best-championship-karate/3030-17478/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18304-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/4/3/22543_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67371-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-best.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/459179-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67372-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67373-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-practice.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67374-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-she.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67375-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-let.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/67376-best-of-the-best-championship-karate-game-boy-screenshot-one.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716841-andrepanza002.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716840-andrepanza001.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2614712-bestofthebest001.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku! - Dokodemo Kin Medal (Japan)">		<description>Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku! - Dokodemo Kin Medal (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="86D11D10" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBikkuri%20Nekketsu%20Shin%20Kiroku%21%20-%20Dokodemo%20Kin%20Medal%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="BAECEE2DFD915A41363FEF736F81853822D5DFCD" size="129775" />		<title_clean>Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku! - Dokodemo Kin Medal</title_clean>		<plot>Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku! is a Sports game, developed by Million and published by Technos Japan,which was released in Japan in 1993.</plot>		<releasedate>16/7/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Million</studio>		<videoid>nLvdpbLK2Qc</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569607-bikkuri-nekketsu-shin-kiroku</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/5/6/306156_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/5/6/306156_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/e/gfs_7663_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/6/e/gfs_7663_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/d/e/gfs_7663_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/c/e/gfs_7663_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/7/e/gfs_7663_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/a/e/gfs_7663_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/1/e/gfs_7663_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/c/f/gfs_7663_1_8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/f/gfs_7663_1_9.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/b/0/gfs_7663_1_10.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure (USA, Europe)">		<description>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="5E8F656A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBill%20%26%20Ted%27s%20Excellent%20Game%20Boy%20Adventure%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="E19A7E5A5BD8FDE0F31773C22DBEBC9B4CF3824E" size="62350" />		<title_clean>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure</title_clean>		<plot>Based on the movie.[CR]You control Bill &amp; Ted- Rufus, a time travelling "dude" from the future, gives you use of a time-travelling telephone booth.

The protagonist is      Rad Spencer, the best of the bionic commando corps, and his mission is to rescue     Super Joe from Director Wiseman's Doraize Dukedom. Using an assortment of guns and his grapple-launching bionic arm, Rad is airdropped into various levels and must locate and destroy their command center or boss to continue.The game is a tried and true platformer, trading the ability to jump for a grappling hook that can be shot horizontally, upwards or up at an angle. It can stun enemies, retrieve items or latch onto solid objects so that Rad can swing about the stage and launch himself into the air. Between levels, Rad gets a ride from a helicopter that can follow branching paths between hostile levels and neutral zones where equipment and contacts can be found. Enemy dropships also patrol the paths; when the helicopter encounters them, Rad is dropped into a short, linear stage where he must defeat parachuting enemies and get to the end of the zone.Over the game, Rad gains specialized pieces of equipment that can offer additional strategic options when in battle. He also gets access to a growing selection of guns to choose from before being airdropped. As each gun can have its advantages, selecting the right tool for the job is the key to victory.The game does not use a save system, instead relying on a password mechanic to let the player pick up where he left off over multiple play sessions. Passwords consist of various geometric shapes arranged on a grid.[CR]Game Boy Vs N.E.S. Differences[CR]Despite sporting drastically different visual styles, both the Game Boy and the Nintendo versions of Bionic Commando have strong similarities. Being a reboot of sorts, Bionic Commando on the Game Boy takes the original story and tweaks it while still paying respect to the original Japanese version.StoryInstead of going up against the Nazis lead by Adolf Hitler, or the Badds led by Generalissimo Killt, Rad instead takes the fight to the Doraize Dukedom and its leader, Director Wiseman (the original name of Killt's character from the Japanese version of the NES Bionic Commando). Additionally, while the NES version had the Badds plot to revive Master D, the Game Boy's Director Wiseman instead only sought to activate the Albatross, a mighty flying fortress.  In the end, both games require the same precise finishing blow to achieve victory, except that the Game Boy's final explosion lacks a certain bit of color (in the form of an animated sequence of Hitler's head exploding).Visual ThemeWhile the original NES title had a contemporary military theme overall, the Game Boy incarnation punches up the technology level into sci-fi territory. Characters leave the modern army templates aside to go for spiky hair, arm-mounted cannons, futuristic armour and the iconic grapple.Of note are the cinematics of the opening sequence, which are a step up from the NES ones. They go so far as to trick depth of field effects out of the limited Game Boy hardware to make backgrounds seem blurry and far away.GameplayTravel over the overland map is still the same in both versions, except that enemy transports were changed from trucks to high-tech dropship aircraft. While in the original, the troop transport encounters were top-down, here they keep the same platform mechanics found in the rest of the game and enemies parachute down instead. The game as a whole is also more forgiving than the NES Bionic Commando, starting the player off with a three-hit lifebar (as opposed to the NES's one-hit-wonder commando) and using a mild RPG element for lengthening it as enemy tokens are obtained.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Re-Equip[CR]Hold the &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;START&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; button and press &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;A&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]Circle -

Although it contained no actual real-world hockey teams, it did contain several teams based on real North American cities. For its Famicom Disk System adaptation it was called Konami (or Konamic) Ice Hockey.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are eight playable teams that are based in real North American cities but bear no relation to their NHL counterparts. The eight teams are Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Chicago, and New York. Each team has one anonymous line of 3 forwards, 2 defensemen and 1 goalie.[CR]There are two game types: Exhibition and Tournament. In Exhibition, the player takes on either a CPU or another human-controlled team for a single match. In Tournament, the player&#8217;s team is placed into a three-round elimination tournament. Both game types can be played on three difficulty levels; Junior, College and Pro.[CR]Although the matches are structured the same as regular hockey games (3 periods of 20 minutes each), the speed of the clock is sped up. There are no offside or penalty calls, with one notable exception. If two players bump into each other a few times, they will start a fight. Interestingly, only the loser is sent to the penalty box. The only other enforced infraction is &#8220;Icing&#8221;. If the game is tied after the 3 periods, it moves to a shootout. The team with the most goals after 5 shots wins, and if the score is still tied, the shootout continues until there is a winner.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 7,7,6,4 stating, "...fast action with little or no smudging on the screen, combined with games within the game that include fight scenes, make Blades a winner..."[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]On the title screen, push Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, B, A, Start.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<studio>Ultra Software Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<videoid>xQ9HVfBDWqc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18308</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585634-blades-of-steel</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/blades-of-steel</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/blades-of-steel/3030-6109/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2361179-nes_bladesofsteel.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56661-blades-of-steel-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/195694-blades-of-steel-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60224-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/460055-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60225-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-select-team.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60226-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-tournament-tree.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60227-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-it-begins-here.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60228-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-uh-oh-not-good.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60229-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-goalkeeper.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60230-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-nooooo.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60231-blades-of-steel-game-boy-screenshot-we-are-loosing-again.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2788309-konamiice001.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Blaster Master Boy (USA)">		<description>Blaster Master Boy (USA)</description>		<rom crc="3B2C7118" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBlaster%20Master%20Boy%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="21B1E574A6F4543651E96DE65994E7B0B7A6A0F6" size="72760" />		<title_clean>Blaster Master Boy</title_clean>		<plot>You thought the world would be free of radioactive threats from the underground world after the events of the original Blaster Master yet for reasons unknown several radioactive hotspots sprout from the ground all over the world.

Yaaaaaaay. It seems like a fairly good one, though. There's the expected Arkanoid business where powerups fall from special blocks and certain blocks take several hits, and you get a lot of other innovations like blocks that fade in and out of existence, blocks that regenerate after a few seconds, exploding blocks, blocks that shoot back at you, boss fights, and so on. Multiball is insane. The music is pretty wretched and repetitious, but what can you do.[CR]The game also, for once in the genre, attaches a goofy little plot, just in case you needed a justification to smash stuff with haphazardly flying projectiles. You are Jon Takahashi, a bounty hunter who "travels all over the universe collecting prize money with his machine, the Reflector." One day a floating robot head named Kuwar enlists him to find the rest of his robot body, which was snatched by evil-doers who get off on dismantling robots, I guess. Which really isn't that appalling, but maybe they're into genocide too, I dunno. Anyway, Jon's getting "10,000,000 paohs" out of it, so he's probably not too concerned.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]The translation is complete! Pentarou's technical work looks very slick, and the English text doesn't look constrained at all. There are the occasional odd sentences and punctuation issues, but Al LaPrade's translation fits nicely with the oddball tone of the story.[CR]Reviewer: Shih Tzu[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/819/[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/2004</releasedate>		<year>2004</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>OeRSTED</studio>		<thegamesdb_id>29842</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569929-block-kuzushi-gb</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/29842-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/6/9/gfs_10040_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/b/9/gfs_10040_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/0/9/gfs_10040_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/9/gfs_10040_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/a/9/gfs_10040_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/7/9/gfs_10040_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/c/9/gfs_10040_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/1/8/gfs_10040_1_8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/a/8/gfs_10040_1_9.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/6/gfs_10040_1_10.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Blodia (Japan)">		<description>Blodia (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="51FF6E53" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBlodia%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="A3927543CA471F479BA7AAE7295788434672464E" size="23719" />		<title_clean>Blodia</title_clean>		<plot>Blodia is a Puzzle game, published by Tonkin House, which was released in Japan in 1990.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/579602.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Tonkin House</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/579602-blodia</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/blodia</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/blodia/3030-25086/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4865/862814-579602_20408_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4865/862818-579602_20408_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594731-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594732-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-select-game-type.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594734-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-warm-up.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594736-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-hurry.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594735-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-maze.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594737-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-hard.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594738-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-congratulations.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/594740-blodia-game-boy-screenshot-stage-edit.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4865/862817-gfs_20408_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4865/862816-gfs_20408_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Blues Brothers, The (USA, Europe)">		<description>Blues Brothers, The (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="ADB66EFF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBlues%20Brothers%2C%20The%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="9DCA8B83A5D73270319CF05396FCCA8E6027E7B0" size="45288" />		<title_clean>Blues Brothers, The</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Blues Brothers is a 1991 game from Titus Interactive that features the titular brothers on the run from the law. Over the course of six levels the brothers must avoid the police while completing smaller tasks like unmasking a shark in a shopping mall. A two player co-op mode is also available.[CR]The game was released on various European and American home computers, and also received NES and Game Boy ports.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of The Blues Brothers is actually its sequel, Jukebox Adventure. The SNES version simply left off the subtitle as it was the first (and only) Blues Brothers game for the system. As such, there is no SNES version of this particular game.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]At release the NES version of the game was awarded scores of 6,6,5,5 from Electronic Gaming Monthly. They said, "...the video game does not cut it. Where is the music? Where are the personalities of the characters? What does this game have to do with the movie in any way? Beyond that though, The Blues Brothers is kind of fun. It's pretty simple, but the game play is there".[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Titus France SA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>a7v50bhS-u0</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18309</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585636-the-blues-brothers</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/blues-brothers</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-blues-brothers/3030-8498/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18309-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/5/1/27251_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161297-the-blues-brothers-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161298-the-blues-brothers-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-player.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161300-the-blues-brothers-game-boy-screenshot-begin-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161301-the-blues-brothers-game-boy-screenshot-avoid-the-cops-and.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161302-the-blues-brothers-game-boy-screenshot-grab-any-records-you.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2763226-blues+brothers%2C+the+%28u%29_004.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2763225-blues+brothers%2C+the+%28u%29_003.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2763224-blues+brothers%2C+the+%28u%29_002.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2763223-blues+brothers%2C+the+%28u%29_001.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/771890-blues__3_.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Blues Brothers, The - Jukebox Adventure (Europe)">		<description>Blues Brothers, The - Jukebox Adventure (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="F1C0FB1D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBlues%20Brothers%2C%20The%20-%20Jukebox%20Adventure%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="2005E94222A1F0EDD30903411343F9570A91D4F3" size="89551" />		<title_clean>Blues Brothers, The - Jukebox Adventure</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure is a platformer game featuring the eponymous jazz musicians.

The Super Nintendo version is simply entitled "The Blues Brothers", but should not be mistaken for the original game.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Titus France SA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>xLjoneWql-g</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18319</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585637-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure/3030-16198/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10522</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18319-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227458-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227459-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-choose.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227460-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227461-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-throwing.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227462-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-it.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227463-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227464-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227465-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-these.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227466-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-beware.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/227468-the-blues-brothers-jukebox-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-a.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bo Jackson - Two Games in One (USA)">		<description>Bo Jackson - Two Games in One (USA)</description>		<rom crc="7EDB78AB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBo%20Jackson%20-%20Two%20Games%20in%20One%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="CB360F44A398FF5CD3818B0E244FFDF7019D85C7" size="92603" />		<title_clean>Bo Jackson - Two Games in One</title_clean>		<plot>It's two games in one -- play either baseball or football in this game headlined by Bo Jackson. In baseball, you can participate in all the major parts of the ballgame, such as pitching, hitting, and fielding. The field is displayed in 3D using an engine called "3-D Sensation." In football, the field is displayed as an overhead view in 2D with tiny players running around -- a sharp contrast to the graphic style of the baseball portion of the game. The football game allows you to design your own plays and watch them with instant replay.</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>THQ Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<videoid>XIO9q-cLZUw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18320</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585638-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/bo-jackson-two-games-in-one</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/bo-jackson-two-games-in-one/3030-13340/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18320-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39058-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147921-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161303-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161304-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161305-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-what-game.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161306-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-football-selected.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161307-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-the-coin-toss.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161308-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-the-kickoff.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161309-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-quarter-s.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161310-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-select-you.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161311-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-i-am-blitzing.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161312-bo-jackson-two-games-in-one-game-boy-screenshot-baseball-selected.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Boggle Plus (USA)">		<description>Boggle Plus (USA)</description>		<rom crc="70C8C799" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBoggle%20Plus%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="D6CF512F7301CCDC2D802F34FBBDE2D0BA2CF3CD" size="85604" />		<title_clean>Boggle Plus</title_clean>		<plot>Boggle Plus is a Puzzle game, developed by Sculptured Software and published by Parker Bros, which was released in 1992.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/585639.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Board Game</genre>		<studio>Parker Brothers</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>zhUsF_op3mg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18321</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585639-boggle-plus</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/boggle-plus/3030-34431/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18321-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/9/4/45994_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/d/1/gfs_38545_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/0/1/gfs_38545_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/4/c/gfs_38545_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/9/c/gfs_38545_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/2/c/gfs_38545_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/3/c/gfs_38545_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/8/c/gfs_38545_2_5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/f/8/gfs_38545_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Bomb Jack (Europe)">		<description>Bomb Jack (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="9BD8815E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBomb%20Jack%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="A2B2799E867777A5A19155ED1F2245630FC03560" size="19480" />		<title_clean>Bomb Jack</title_clean>		<plot>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.[CR]In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.[CR]The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Infogrames Europe SA</studio>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>2JRkNc8FmHA</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21630</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/924236-bomb-jack</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/bomb-jack</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/bomb-jack/3030-185/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13066</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21630-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7930/624742-bomb_jack__encore__uk_box_art__back_.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65244-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/149057-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-level-1-with-pyramids.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/149058-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-level-2-with-greek-temple.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/149059-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-level-3-with-medieval-architecture.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161288-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161289-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-on-to-level-2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161290-bomb-jack-game-boy-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1579/1309350-bombjackarcadescreen2.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1579/1309349-bombjackarcadescreen1.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8303/1196316-bj64_1.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/EqKVfIj.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Bomber Boy (Japan)">		<description>Bomber Boy (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="EF9595AC" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBomber%20Boy%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="A9BADDFB693F20057B17C084422D7BFAC590F2BA" size="74973" />		<title_clean>Bomber Boy</title_clean>		<plot>Atomic Punk is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hudson,which was released in Japan in 1990.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]Enter these codes at the Password screen[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]To go to Stage 50, enter the password: [B]B 0 M N D P B L 3 N C B 3 L 2 H 2 D J J[/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain more Golds (EU Version)[CR]Enter "QQ88Q8Q7" at the Bomber Boy password screen to see the ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] More money[CR]Get the password for a game and then change the first letter to an X.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] More money[CR]Intentionally lose a ''B'' mode game and receive the password.

After you beat him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then three Bombermen.[CR]After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of three rounds, you must beat a boss character to move on. When playing the rounds, you can find power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run faster, ram enemies, etc.[CR]In a multi-player game, two to four players do their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than two players is only possible with a multitap.[CR]This game was released in the U.S. as Wario Blast, with some changes.

In arcade versions, Bonk would be accompanied by a female version of himself.[CR]In Bonk's Adventure, the player assumes the role of the caveman Bonk. The player must navigate their way through five different worlds to rescue Princess Za, who has been captured by the dinosaur, King Drool. In a time when consoles had to have mascots, Bonk was the solution for the TurboGrafx-16. As a platformer it would be held in direct comparison to Mario and Sonic. Although it was a star when it came to graphics, in particular color palette, it never garnered enough popular appeal to push sales of the Turbo-Grafx.[CR]In November/December 2006, Bonk's Adventure was released on the Wii's Virtual Console. It is currently available for 600 Nintendo Points and supports all controller types. It was also added to the PlayStation Network store in 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bonk's weapon is his large head, which can be used to defeat the various prehistoric enemies that stand in his way. While on the ground, Bonk smashes his head forward. In the air the headbutt creates a spin that, by pressing the button repeatedly, can slow Bonk's descent. Bonk is capable of juggling an opponent, gaining more points with each consecutive hit. The term juggling makes particular sense in this game since each time Bonk hits the enemy from below they pop up in an arc and Bonk must run to catch them before they land. Lives are gained through score, as well as found within the world, although they are few and far between.[CR]In addition to prehistoric monsters there are a number of pod-like flowers that offer goodies for Bonk. Some of those goodies are fruits and vegetables that boost Bonk's score. Others contain meat, and an handful are hidden monsters that will pop up and bounce after Bonk.[CR]If Bonk collects meat he evolves. There are 3 different levels for Bonk to evolve to. The first level is where he starts. The second level Bonk gets blue tints and is able to pound the ground and temporarily freeze enemies. The third level turns Bonk into an invulnerable, green tinted version of himself. This invulnerability only last a short time. Meat comes in two forms: Small meat will only transform Bonk one level whereas large meat will transform him two levels. After enough time, and without more meat, Bonk will revert back to his original self.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 5 levels in Bonk's Adventure. Each has a number of sub-level to complete that basically requires Bonk to move to the right, jump over enemies and avoid pits and traps. Occasionally there would be doors for Bonk to enter, which would result in a mini-game. These mini-games include a vertical drop where the challenge is for Bonk to spin and eventually land on his feet; a challenge to headbutt rocks of lava that come out of a volcano, and a jumping challenge where Bonk bounces from flower to flower trying to collect the most fruit without falling into the pits below. After completing the mini-game Bonk is dropped back into the world he came from in the exact state he left it. After 8 mini-levels Bonk encounters a boss by hopping in a bizarre dinosaur skull elevator.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]In total there are six different bosses in the game, four of which are being controlled by King Drool. Each boss wears some sort of headgear which Bonk must destroy by headbutting it until it breaks.HueyHuey, the game's first boss.[CR]Huey is one of the enemies being brainwashed by King Drool. He blows bubbles as an attack, and requires fifteen hits to beat. After a few hits, the brainwashing helmet is damaged and on the fifteenth blow is subdued.[CR]"Gee Wiz!! Thanks!! I feel a lot better. I'm your new friend. Arf Arf Arf!!"Gladdis[CR]Gladdis has the ability to create a clone of herself, after which Bonk must attack the real Gladdis with a head stomp. The imaginary Gladdis will jump around and throw stars, but Bonk will pass seamlessly through her. In the next phase of her pattern, Gladdis returns to a single form and teleports around the screen, shooting stars at Bonk.[CR]"You're my hero!! You've won my heart and mind, Bonk!!"Kongo Zilla[CR]Kongo Zilla's stage takes place on icy terrain, which makes handling Bonk more difficult. Kongo Zilla digs underground with his spiked arms and throws ice blocks at Bonk.[CR]"You made a monkey out of me, Bonk. Come to think of it, I am a monkey! By the way, have you seen Princess Za?"Punchy Pedro[CR]Punchy Pedro is named for his punches. One of which is quick and the other of which does a significant amount of damage. As with all bosses, his head of the weak spot to aim for.[CR]"You really rang my bell on that one. It feels great to be out in the light. Now I can find my beloved Princess!"[CR]After these four bosses are beaten, Bonk will have to fight them all in succession, although Kongo Zilla won't have his icy floor to make Bonk slip.T. Ractor Head[CR]When Bonk gets to Princess Za, he finds out that she has also been brainwashed by King Drool, and Bonk will have to fight T. Ractor Head to save her. He has all of the previous bosses' abilities, as well as a volcano which shoots rocks and homing darts. Once Bonk defeats him, Princess Za comes out of her brainwashed state.[CR]"I am Princess Za from Moonland!!"[CR]"My people had been brainwashed!!"[CR]"Help me get back to Moonland!!"King Drool[CR]King Drool uses a shield which renders him invincible. He shoots fireballs and later dives at Bonk from the sky.[CR]Items[CR]There are many items and powerups which Bonk will come across on his travels.Small Meat[CR]One piece will give Bonk the ability to headbutt the ground, stunning all nearby enemies, and two pieces will grant temporary invincibility.Large Meat[CR]Equivalent to two pieces of small meat.Vegetables[CR]Vegetables will give 50 points, as well as regaining a small amount of health.Fruit[CR]Fruit will give 100 points and regain twice as much health as vegetables.Red Heart[CR]Red hearts fill up a section of health.Blue Heart[CR]Blue hearts raise the amount of health sections by one.Extra Life[CR]These are found sparingly through levels, but are also received every 100,000 points.Smiley Faces[CR]Collect all of these in a level and receive an award at the end, akin to Super Mario World's dragon coins.[CR]PS Vita Compatibility[CR]Despite not being in the official compatibility list, Bonk's Adventure can be played on the PS Vita. To do this, the user must first download the game to the PS3. From there, go to Content Transfer on the PS Vita and select the game for transfer.

And what better way is there to earn money than pushing  crates? And there are lots of crates to be pushed in all 120  levels of the game. The new levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 and its predecessor as there are no graphical changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, you'll once again have to push crates onto certain spots, which is made difficult by the fact that you can only push but not pull them so that it can easily happen that you push a crate into a dead end or block your own way. A password records your progress, but there is no battery to save your self-created levels.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>FCI</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<videoid>7GKFtW2G99k</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18324</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585644-boxxle-2</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/boxxle-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/boxxle-ii/3030-16266/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18324-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224515-boxxle-ii-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253301-boxxle-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204721-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-japanese-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97298-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97299-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97300-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-music-menu.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97301-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-this-is-more-difficult-than-it.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97302-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-this-is-just-as-difficult-as.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97303-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-zoomed-out.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97304-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-almost-done.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97305-boxxle-ii-game-boy-screenshot-creating-your-own-levels.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/1/2/gfs_3198_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Brain Bender (USA)">		<description>Brain Bender (USA)</description>		<rom crc="FBB1F2A1" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBrain%20Bender%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="56FF8684284765A56918D14620AD38477AAAF0AD" size="21249" />		<title_clean>Brain Bender</title_clean>		<plot>Test your prowess as a master of mirrors in one of the world's most exciting new puzzle games, Brain Bender!

In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.[CR]There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master System[CR]The 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and Genesis[CR]The 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and Amiga[CR]Similar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOS[CR]The Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Room[CR]In the first level, Daytime Part 1 (A Journey Through Transylvania),  go the regular way.

The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.[CR]It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level[CR]Bubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.[CR]There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a character[CR]whales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.[CR]The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home Versions[CR]The home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made.

The sequel to Bubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Bubsy II puts players back in the role of Bubsy, the wise-cracking anthropomorphic bobcat, as he sets off through the Amazatorium (a museum full of portals to different worlds) to defeat the tyrannical anthropomorphic pig leader, Oinkton P. Hamm.[CR]Unlike the previous game, Bubsy can enter any of the six worlds he wants to at any time (with the exception of the last world, which must be unlocked by completing the other five). He also now has a health system (in which he can take up to three hits from normal enemies before he dies, unless he finds a special healing item) and multiple gadgets that can be purchased by collecting trading cards (such as a "smart bomb", a diving suit, a cartoonish black hole to hide in, and ammo for his toy weapon). Score-giving yarnballs are now replaced with marbles, and the "Woolies" are replaced with various baddies.[CR]A handheld version was released for the Game Boy in 1995.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Pause the game and press Up, Up, Down, Select, A, A, B, B.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Accolade</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>8g6udaSfz8o</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18335</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575819-bubsy-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/bubsy-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/bubsy-ii/3030-17096/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9079</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2363671-snes_bubsy2.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/2/6/38026_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277353-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-opening-credits.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277369-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-it-goes-on-to-say.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277370-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277371-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-ah-the-good-old-days-of-not-many.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277372-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-the-amazatorium-is-where-you.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277373-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-three-levels-to-choose-from-to.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277374-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-the-entry-point-of-level-one.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277375-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-flying-birds-and-men-in-suits.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277376-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-bubsy-can-float-back-down-to.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/277377-bubsy-ii-game-boy-screenshot-the-end-of-each-level-reveals.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/jwEJYKs.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2, The (USA)">		<description>Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2, The (USA)</description>		<rom crc="A973E604" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBugs%20Bunny%20Crazy%20Castle%202%2C%20The%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="1E4C8C8FE8B6C34F76CD0DA876442F14299DA725" size="60283" />		<title_clean>Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2, The</title_clean>		<plot>Bugs is back in the palm of your hand and here's 'What's Up, Doc:' Nasty Witch Hazel has nabbed Honey Bunny from a party in the castle and locked her away.This time you'll have to hunt through 28 huge, multi-level rooms to help Bugs rescue his main squeeze.

In each of the sixty or so levels in the Crazy Castle, Bugs must collect all of the carrots in each stage before moving on to the next. Standing in Bugs's way are fellow Looney Tunes characters Yosemite Sam, Sylvester, and Daffy Duck, who wander around the stage and attempt to catch him.[CR]The player can defeat enemies by either hitting them with a boxing glove power-up or by dropping a weight, such as a flower pot, onto their head. There is also a power-up that can make Bugs invincible for a short period of time, and he is also invulnerable while being transported through a pipe or moving through a doorway. One thing that Bugs cannot do, however, is jump.[CR]In its original Japanese release, the game featured Roger Rabbit, from the Amblin/Disney movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. However, when Kemco released the game in the US later the same year, they could not use the Roger Rabbit license in that territory because it had already been purchased by LJN for their Roger Rabbit game, released around the same time. Instead, the game's sprites were reworked to resemble Looney Tunes characters. The two versions are otherwise identical. This would be a common issue for most of Kemco's later Crazy Castle games, as the Japanese versions would invariably feature Disney characters that would be switched out for Looney Tunes characters for their US/EU releases because of licensing issues.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/3/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Nintendo Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.1</rating>		<videoid>eVkZIjgwO7w</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18336</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585649-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/bugs-bunny-crazy-castle</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle/3030-12029/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5081</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18336-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218764-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253282-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191917-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111062-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/96270-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20456-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-screenshot-bugs-bunny.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20457-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-screenshot-collect-the.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20458-the-bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-game-boy-screenshot-multiple-sylvesters.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2790054-roger+rabbit+%281989%29%28kemco%29_004.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2790053-roger+rabbit+%281989%29%28kemco%29_003.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2790052-roger+rabbit+%281989%29%28kemco%29_002.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2790051-roger+rabbit+%281989%29%28kemco%29_001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2790050-bugsbunny001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4730/1654200-bugs_bunny_crazy_castle_nes_screenshot1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4730/1654199-bunny.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Burai Fighter Deluxe (USA, Europe)">		<description>Burai Fighter Deluxe (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="3C86F5DB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBurai%20Fighter%20Deluxe%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="178E18B7E6E65E726B4E06F80D89C55332EA868B" size="39518" />		<title_clean>Burai Fighter Deluxe</title_clean>		<plot>The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures - the robo-mutants.

Give Chef Peter Pepper a helping hand to create the ultimate hamburger. Each ingredient is located on a different platform, and you must climb a series of ladders in order to reach them all. Walk across the ingredient to drop it closer to the waiting plate below. Once all the burgers have been completed, you'll be able to move on to the next level. But watch out: Renegade ingredients will stop at nothing to put an end to your cooking days. Dodge them, stun them using pepper or drop a hamburger ingredient on top of them to stop their chase. If you run out of pepper, collect bonus foods such as coffee, chocolate and fries to recharge.

On the front of the building there are multiple signs or posters that hang on it. Bugs will crawl up the building and shoot projectiles at the player.[CR]The goal is to burn pieces of the signs to make them fall down and eliminate the bugs. Players manipulate a crosshair on the screen which indicates where the laser will fire. Holding the A button causes the laser to fire. To get pieces of the signs to fall they must be "cut" out of it in a similar style to something like Qix.[CR]If all parts of the signs are already removed and a bug comes up through that area the player will have no options to defeat them and will lose a life.[CR]On top of the laser, the player can also jump or use various items using the B button. Every so often the player will encounter a boss character. There are only four total bosses in the game which require the player to use different tactics than the normal stages.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Logic</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575114-burning-paper</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/burning-paper/3030-34430/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1730874-burning_paper.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632836-burning+paper+box+art+back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632834-burning+paper+7.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632833-burning+paper+6.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632832-burning+paper+5.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632831-burning+paper+4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632830-burning+paper+3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632829-burning+paper+2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2632828-burning+paper+1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/3/d/gfs_15010_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/e/d/gfs_15010_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/5/d/gfs_15010_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Bust-A-Move 2 - Arcade Edition (USA, Europe)">		<description>Bust-A-Move 2 - Arcade Edition (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="B94724E6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FBust-A-Move%202%20-%20Arcade%20Edition%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="6B0942C231890D3E2F6C18E7804040EB4C66DCB3" size="97208" />		<title_clean>Bust-A-Move 2 - Arcade Edition</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The objective of the game is to remove all the bubbles off a stage without the bubbles going underneath the line.[CR] Types of Bubbles [CR] Aim carefully![CR]Normal Bubbles: There are no special qualities on what these bubbles can do.

Data East handled the Genesis version themselves, though the SNES, Game Boy and Game Gear versions were licensed out to Mindscape who contracted Realtime Associates the develop the games. The NES game plays a little differently, more of a standard platformer game, and doesn't have as many playable characters.[CR]Taking control of one of the classic (1980s-90s) Marvel Avengers, the player battles their way through five levels in order to prevent Red Skull from carrying out his nefarious plan. The player(s), as either Captain America, Iron Man, Vision, or Hawkeye, fights their way through cities, space, and even underwater. Occasionally other Avengers show up to help the team: Quicksilver by bringing health, Wonderman with a hover craft (for the two Avengers not capable of flight), Namor with a diving suit, and The Wasp becomes an auxiliary attack.[CR]Marvel villains Whirlwind, Grim Reaper, Mandarin, The Juggernaut, Crossbones, and, of course, Red Skull all make appearances as well as quite a few others (including what looks like a Sentinel from the X-Men universe).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each hero has a similar set of abilities. There are two jump attacks (one if the player taps jump and attack, the other for holding jump and then pressing attack), they can dash at enemies to knock them down, a projectile (laser weapons for The Vision and Iron Man, arrows for Hawkeye, and Captain America's shield), and a series of punches and kicks followed by a throw.Iron Man is so lazy.[CR]Every couple of levels the brawling action is broken up with side-scrolling shooter sequences. There are three of these: one in space, one underwater, and one in a war-torn city.[CR]The levels are two miscellaneous cities, underwater, a secret underwater base, and the moon.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Mindscape</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<videoid>gJCTePxrdEs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18595</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585655-captain-america-and-the-avengers</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/captain-america-and-the-avengers</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/captain-america-and-the-avengers/3030-10696/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18595-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/165930/2307742-captainamericaandtheavengers_gb_back_usa.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444137-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444138-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444139-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-choose.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444140-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-opening.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444141-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-scene.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444142-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-starting.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444143-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-throwing.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444144-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-taking.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444145-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-a-drop.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444146-captain-america-and-the-avengers-game-boy-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Captain Tsubasa J - Zenkoku Seiha e no Chousen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Captain Tsubasa J - Zenkoku Seiha e no Chousen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="33A1E1CF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCaptain%20Tsubasa%20J%20-%20Zenkoku%20Seiha%20e%20no%20Chousen%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="D3F9C5700389F7A876A4A821DB1F99E7DA4A6F68" size="259024" />		<title_clean>Captain Tsubasa J - Zenkoku Seiha e no Chousen</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captain Tsubasa J: Zenkoku Seiha e no Chousen is a soccer game developed and published by Bandai for the Game Boy platform.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Matches Password[CR]Here are the all matches password.

You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.[CR]The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.[CR]Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine.

This game was later recreated for the Wii as Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Castlevania: The Adventure borrows the most rudimentary basics of Castlevania gameplay for the inaugural Game Boy outing: specifically, a lumbering protagonist with limited mobility; a whip that can be upgraded into a chain whip; undead foes; candles that contain pickups; and Dracula as the big bad.[CR]While many in the Belmont clan may be described as slow-moving, Christopher Belmont is especially so. His jumps in this game do not cover as much distance as his fellow Belmonts. He may therefore be considered much harder to control, and his adventure much more difficult to complete, than other Castlevania protagonists and games.[CR]Christopher's whip, as in other Castlevania titles, can be upgraded multiple times. Picking up an orb from a destroyed candle will upgrade the regular whip to a longer and more powerful chain whip; picking up one more will add a fireball attack to the whip. However, each time Christopher takes a hit, his whip downgrades one level.[CR]There are no sub-weapons (boomerang crosses, holy water, axes, etc.) in Castlevania: The Adventure. Therefore the pickups in candles are limited to the whip upgrade orbs; coins for score purposes; crosses that render Christopher invulnerable for a short period of time; and the aforementioned hearts that refill your life meter. There are also no stairs; vertical progress here is achieved through the use of ropes.[CR]The game progresses through four linear stages, with a countdown timer visible at the top of the screen in a minutes:seconds format. Secret areas containing pickups can be accessed by climbing ropes through false ceilings. Each of the stages is capped by a boss enemy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Life in level 1[CR]In the first level, do not hit the first candle. Now when you come to the 11th candle, hit it to reveal a 1-Up.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Life in level 1[CR]Much like other Castlevania games, you can keep on playing with harder difficulties after the credits roll.  Once 'The End' appears on the screen, press the A button to play through the game again with damage from creatures increased twofold. This will continue to increase with each subsequent loop through the four stages. - Stage 5 to 8: Enemy damage x2- Stage 9 to 12: Enemy damage x4- Stage 13 to 16: Enemy damage x8- Stage 17 to 20: Enemy damage x16 (Instant Death) Clearing Stage 20 will not increase the difficulty any further. However, your score and the Stage number will still increase.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Room In Stage 1[CR]You must climb the ropes to get through the level. The second to last rope, on the right hand side of the screen, leads to a platform with a tree stump and two graves with crosses visible. If you climb up this rope, you can continue through the brick wall at the top.  This leads to a hidden room with four power-ups.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Room In Stage 1[CR]In the second part of the stage, where you have to choose between between ropes, go right and then left. You will enter a room where you go down stairs and giant eyeballs speed towards you. Kill an eyeball while it's on the middle step. Once done, a hole will open up. Climb down it for power-ups.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1989</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>5qEZ-5FIZVc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3172</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585660-castlevania-the-adventure</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/castlevania-the-adventure</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/castlevania-the-adventure/3030-8654/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6812</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3172-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3172-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119885-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210435-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103534-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19345-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19346-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-the-start-of.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19347-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-climbing-a-rope.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19348-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-creepy-giant.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19349-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-mountain-top.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19350-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-a-bat.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/19351-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-first-level-boss.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/544264-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-stage-2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/544265-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-taking-the-upper.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/544266-castlevania-the-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-surrounded-by.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3172-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/541ZiO4.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Castlevania II - Belmont's Revenge (USA, Europe)">		<description>Castlevania II - Belmont's Revenge (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="8875C8FE" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCastlevania%20II%20-%20Belmont%27s%20Revenge%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="696B9AD1E9CFB7112977C9A7C05CF64FE8423D8A" size="89192" />		<title_clean>Castlevania II - Belmont's Revenge</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge (not to be confused with Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and known in Japan as Dracula Legends II) is a 2D action horror platformer developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy in August 1991.[CR]The sequel to Castlevania: The Adventure, Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge re-adds the sub-weapon system from the previous Castlevania games. Similar to the original Mega Man games, this game allows the player to play the four initial stages in any order.[CR]Set 15 years after vampire hunter Christopher Belmont defeats Count Dracula, Dracula returns and kidnaps Christopher's son, Soleiyu. The forces of darkness transforms Soleiyu into a demon, which aids Dracula's resurrection into human form. Players control Christopher as he travels through five castles in order to confront Dracula and rescue his son.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Refined from its predecessor, Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge features smoother control and more well thought-out level design.[CR]In this go round, Christopher covers slightly more ground with his jumps, and it seems as if it's easier for the player to land successful jumps. Moreover, the levels seem to have been designed with jumps that are more reasonable for a man of Christopher's athleticism (or lack thereof) to land.[CR]Christopher also walks faster, and while "lumbering" is still an apt adjective for him (or any 8-bit Belmont for that matter), the game feels far more akin to a traditional NES Castlevania title than did its predecessor. Christopher is still slow to climb the ropes used for vertical progress (as did its predecessor, this game lacks stairs), but can now slide quickly down those ropes if the player holds down the "A" button while climbing down. This is not only a convenience but also a necessary mechanic for avoiding moving spike walls while on a rope.[CR]Christopher retains the twice-upgradeable whip (normal to chain to chain-fireball), but no longer loses his upgrade when hit by any enemy (though there are specific enemy attacks may downgrade his whip a level). The chain whip is twice as powerful as the normal whip; each fireball does the same damage as a normal whip strike.[CR]Sub-weapons make an appearance here as well. They are limited to the Axe and Holy Water, but already these are useful additions to Christopher's arsenal and give the player a few more options to tinker with, further separating Belmont's Revenge from the previous game in the series.[CR]Accordingly, hearts do the traditional Castlevania job of serving as ammunition for these sub-weapons. Coins make their return here from the previous game, with the Castlevania staple of pot roast serving as the standard health-replenishment item. 1-ups can also be found on occasion. Hearts, coins, and sub-weapons are found in candles, with pot roast and 1-ups being hidden in destructible walls throughout the game's levels.[CR]Progress[CR]As mentioned above, Christopher can elect the order in which he tackles the first four stages of the game. They are the Crystal Palace; Sky Palace; Plant Palace; and Rock Palace. As their names would imply, each level carries with it its own theme and hazards. Each of these levels is largely linear, though there are limited instances where you can choose between one of two different paths through a small portion of the level. Capping off each of these levels is a boss enemy[CR]After the initial four bosses have been defeated, Dracula's Castle surfaces in the center of the stage select screen. At this point, Christopher is launched into a completely linear portion of the game that mimics the first Castlevania on NES: Each individual level represents a different area of Dracula's Castle as Christopher battles to the spire.[CR]When Christopher loses all of his lives, he is afforded unlimited continues. Using a continue will drop you at a mid-level checkpoint if you've reached far enough, and you also are afforded a password in case you want to pick up Christopher's adventure at a later time. Progression is therefore much more forgiving in this game than its predecessor.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords for the desired effect:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play at any castle with 10 lives[CR]1)First, enter the Extra Lives password [CR]2)Start playing at any castle [CR]3)Reset the game (press the 4 buttons at the same time) [CR]4)Enter any castle password [CR]5)Bingo!!!, you can play with 10 lives (at any castle).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Rooms And Passages[CR]In the Crystal Castle just past the second door, where eyeballs are falling from above,  climb any rope through the ceiling.In the Rock Castle after the third door, continue all the way to the right and climb the rope up through the ceiling.In the room just before the third door in the Cloud Castle, climb the rope through the ceiling to warp to an earlier room where you can find meat in the bricks in the middle of the ceiling.After the third door in the Plant Castle, continue to the left and climb the rope through the ceiling.In stage two of Dracula's Castle, climb through the ceiling in the room with a door, a large bat, and an upside down monster that can take away your stronger whips.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>dSaorGLcjrc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3167</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585659-castlevania-ii-belmonts-revenge</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/castlevania-ii-belmonts-revenge</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/castlevania-ii-belmonts-revenge/3030-16921/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6813</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3167-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3167-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/95439-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183254-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20801-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20802-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-stage.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20803-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-crystal.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20804-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-cloud.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20805-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-plant.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20806-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-rock-castle.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635729-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-my-feet.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635730-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-go-to.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635731-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-i-m-too.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635732-castlevania-ii-belmont-s-revenge-game-boy-screenshot-moving.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/DDdJUXT.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Castlevania Legends (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Castlevania Legends (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="AD9C17FB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCastlevania%20Legends%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="91A8E49BF6EAC5FE62EC2CC5E6DECBD08CE9B515" size="118704" />		<title_clean>Castlevania Legends</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Sonia Belmont, the game's main protagonist[CR]Castlevania Legends (known in Japan as Devil's Castle Dracula: Dark Night Prelude) is a 2D action horror platformer developed by KCE Nagoya and published by Konami for the Game Boy in March 11, 1998.[CR]Set as a prelude to the Castlevania franchise, the game puts players in 1450 as Sonia Belmont (mother of Trevor Belmont) who sets out to destroy the evil Count Dracula with help from Dracula's deserted son, Alucard.[CR]Castlevania Legends is one of the few Castlevania stories that was officially retconned out of the official timeline after Koji Igarashi was given creative control of the franchise. He later produced Castlevania: Lament of Innocence as the new origin of the timeline.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Castlevania Legends packs in many more game mechanics than either of its predecessors did, perhaps combined. Along with the upgradeable whip and rope slide featured in Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge, Sonia is offered the following abilities:[CR]Burning Mode - pressing both buttons renders Sonia invincible for a short period of time, and gives her the ability to do double damage. This ability is limited to once per life on a given stage and is governed by a countdown meter.[CR]Crouching Walk - Sonia can pass through low barriers by walking forward as she crouches. This is the same ability Simon Belmont has in Castlevania IV for the Super NES.[CR]Soul Weapons - Sonia can use five different magical attacks, which take the place of the traditional sub-weapons in Castlevania lore and the mere two sub-weapons from Belmont's Revenge. Instead, the Axe, Holy Water, Cross Boomerang, Dagger, and Time Stopper are special collectibles that you need to find in order to get the "real" ending.[CR]Air Control - Unlike the 8-bit Belmonts featured in games prior, Sonia has some amount of air control while jumping. There's not quite enough to allow her to easily jump onto a platform directly over her head (though it may be possible with precision timing), but it does offer the player enough to avoid some enemy contact or prevent overshooting a jump.[CR]Castlevania Legends also offers vertically-scrolling areas, where the majority--if not all--of the previous two games achieved vertical progression screen-by-screen.[CR]The level design is mostly linear but has some path divergences where you can find the aforementioned special collectibles, one-ups, et cetera. These divergences are more than single-screen hidden areas, such that you'll veer off the beaten path for a short distance, though not enough to get you lost. There are also trap areas triggered by striking certain candles, landing you into a pit of respawning zombies that you must continue to slay until they're all gone, at which point you're returned to the room above.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Level[CR]The hidden level is in stage 5. After you beat the first boss, a jumping demon creature, you must go through the doors to get to the next screen. There will be two paths: up and to the right. As the right leads to an empty room, go straight up but stay to the right. There will be an opening in the wall leading to the next screen. This screen will have two bats hanging from the ceiling with a platform below. Below this platform is another smaller platform, which is over the hole in the floor. Jump down this hole. While falling you will see a candle: whip it. After you get the 1-Up candle, you will land on a platform. On this platform will be a white candle: whip this then proceed to get off the platform. Do not exit the room. The floor below will disappear. Jump through it to get to the hidden level.</plot>		<releasedate>14/3/1998</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami of America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<ESRB>T - Teen</ESRB>		<videoid>GKo5_9fQl2E</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>11526</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/564357-castlevania-legends</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/castlevania-legends</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/castlevania-legends/3030-12001/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8633</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11526-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11526-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189356-castlevania-legends-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21682-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21683-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-first-level.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21684-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-first-level-boss.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21685-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-second-level.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21686-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-level-3-super-game.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21687-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-fourth-level-super.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/605251-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-from-the-intro.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/605252-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-the-map-sort-of.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/605253-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-level-1-it-s-a-dead.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/605254-castlevania-legends-game-boy-screenshot-level-2-ah-i-ve-been.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11526-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/MRSUrR7.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Catrap (USA)">		<description>Catrap (USA)</description>		<rom crc="ADB96150" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCatrap%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="171E4D54F22F8DC137D12828FCC2DA9874C56970" size="23110" />		<title_clean>Catrap</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A puzzle game that was originally released for the Sharp MZ in 1985. However, the most well known version of the game was released in 1990 for the original Game Boy. The Game Boy version was later re-released via the 3DS Virtual Console.The Game Boy version features two characters (a boy and a girl) that have been cursed with cat-like features, they must traverse puzzle rooms to find and defeat all the enemies. There are 100 levels in total; 99 of which may be played in any order, the final level can only be played after the completion of the other 99. Player can also generate a password that will recall what levels they&#8217;ve already completed.The rooms gradually increase in difficulty from completely straightforward A to B levels to incredibly complex patterns of boulders, ladders, and destructible walls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In the Game Boy version, the player chooses between playing as the male cat or the female cat. However, there are several levels where the player plays as both characters simultaneously; the player must switch back and forth between them to maneuver through the puzzle room.Each level features at least one enemy; the goal being to reach all enemies and destroy them. The enemies cannot harm the main characters, so the difficulty is in finding the correct route through the level without getting stuck. If the player believes they&#8217;ve made a mistake, they can rewind time as far back as they please and try again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus Room Passwords[CR]Enter the Edit Mode from the Main Menu and then input the password from there.

If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. [CR]Insect Opponents and Mushrooms[CR]All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:[CR]1. The Centipede[CR]The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.[CR]Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head.

It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.[CR]The Flea[CR]The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms.

After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.[CR]The Scorpion[CR]The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.[CR]Mushrooms[CR]Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom.

You play as a robot named Chalvo, who can transform himself into a bouncing ball.[CR]Chalvo will need to bounce his way through several stages. In each stage he will need to find five crystals to open the door to the boss room. Armed only with his bouncing and block-pushing skills, Chalvo must also maneuver around enemies and spikes, as well as other obstacles that will kill him instantly. There will also be doors that can only opened by collecting "GO" blocks.[CR]This game was developed by Japan System Supply as the successor to the canceled Virtual Boy game, Bound High. Bound High was said to be one of the games that might've at least delayed the Virtual Boy's death had Nintendo not canceled it. But as Nintendo has the only known copy, we'll never know.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]This translation was discovered floating around the Internet as a hacked ROM. Unable to find any contacts for the original author, KingMike has taken liberty of converting it to a patch, as a service to the community.

If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.[CR]All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. [CR]There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:[CR]1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship.

If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.[CR]2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]4.

Playing as a member of the Special Chase Investigation Department, players are tasked with chasing down the A.I controlled car before finally taking them down. The arcade version of the game included 5 levels for the player to play through.[CR]It was later ported onto home console and computer, including the critically acclaimed ZX Spectrum version, by Daiei Seisakusho and Ocean Software.[CR]It is a spiritual successor to Taito's Full Throttle. In turn, the game spawned two arcade based sequels called  Special Criminal Investigation in 1988 and Super Chase: Criminal Termination in 1992.[CR]The Turbografx-16 version of the game was released onto the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console in July 2008 costing 600 Wii points.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Viewed from a similar behind the car perspective as  OutRun there is an initial 60 second time limit for the player to reach the fleeing vehicle. This is often made more difficult by having more cars on the road and also by providing the player with a choice of two branching roads to take; with one being a slower route than the other to the enemy car. Once the enemy car is caught up with another 60 seconds is given to the player within which they have to bump into the car a certain amount of times forcing it pull over to the side of the road. The game has 5 different criminals, one for each level:1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher2. Carlos, the New York armed robber3. Chicago pushers4. L.A kidnapper5. Eastern Bloc Spy[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game's chase-themed driving gameplay, which involved ramming into enemy cars while avoiding the traffic, was a precursor to the chase/combat driving gameplay of later titles such as Road Rash, Mario Kart, Driver, Burnout, Grand Theft Auto, and Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<videoid>D_5cH7l-FFo</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18609</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/196902-chase-hq</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/chase-hq</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chase-hq/3030-13281/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18609-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207031-chase-h-q-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207032-chase-h-q-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/209869-chase-h-q-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/276119-chase-h-q-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102235-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102236-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-taito-monitoring-system.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102237-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-stage-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102238-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-a-car-gets-in-your-way.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102239-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-driving-through-a-tunnel.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102240-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-fork-in-the-road.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102241-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-obstacles-on-the-road.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102242-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-there-he-is.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102243-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-apprehended-the-suspect.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102244-chase-h-q-game-boy-screenshot-stage-clear-bonus.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Chessmaster, The (DMG-N5) (USA) (Rev A)">		<description>Chessmaster, The (DMG-N5) (USA) (Rev A)</description>		<rom crc="59ED370C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FChessmaster%2C%20The%20%28DMG-N5%29%20%28USA%29%20%28Rev%20A%29.zip" sha1="F0351FAAB8B912967552684D4160F5CF94540D41" size="42519" />		<title_clean>Chessmaster, The</title_clean>		<plot>The Chessmaster is a game where the player has the chance to play against the CPU controlled Chessmaster at a standard game of chess.

Only released in Japan, the title translates roughly to "Earth Liberation Army." Since the game's release, it has seen minimal coverage and sparse reviews, although those that have reviewed it are positive in regards to ZAS, due to its detailed graphics, varied gameplay, and multi-level scrolling backgrounds.[CR]The graphics in Chikyuu Kaihou Gun ZAS are fairly unique in terms of "Game Boy space shooters." The game uses the Game Boy's screen blurriness to its advantage, creating effects such as a scrolling background and transparency. This makes the game slightly difficult to play on an emulator or Super Game Boy, as these effects are translated to flickering sprites rather than the smoothness that would be seen on an original Game Boy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]ZAS uses transparency to create detailed backgrounds.[CR]ZAS is extremely similar to R-Type in terms of gameplay. ZAS contains five stages; a mixture of tight enclosures akin to R-Type, and open air battles. Each stage is littered with enemies, obstacles, and power-ups, and each level has a boss at the end that must be faced before the player can progress to the next level. Power-ups include a variety of objects, such as extra ships, extra lives, better lasers, and shielding.[CR]After completing all five of the game's levels, players are presented with an ending cinematic which depicts the player's ship flying back to Earth.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>18/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>T&amp;E Soft</studio>		<videoid>skzu3VL7_38</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569538-chikyuu-kaihou-gun-zas</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chikyuu-kaihou-gun-zas/3030-32925/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13357</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2392880-chikyuu_kaihou_gun_zas.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559381-zas__japan_13.png</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559380-zas__japan_12.png</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559379-zas__japan_11.png</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559378-zas__japan_10.png</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559377-zas__japan_9.png</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559376-zas__japan_7.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559375-zas__japan_6.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559374-zas__japan_4.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559373-zas__japan_3.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1559372-zas__japan_2.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/aaQEw22.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Choplifter II (Japan)">		<description>Choplifter II (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="5109F484" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FChoplifter%20II%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="9392FFC6831D5F029F5AD906AF40B607B8EB221B" size="71520" />		<title_clean>Choplifter II</title_clean>		<plot>Choplifter II is an Action game, developed by Beam Software and published by Victor Interactive Software,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1991</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>Beam Software</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<videoid>7daUZDdDNIY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18584</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585666-choplifter-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/choplifter-iii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/choplifter-iii/3030-9123/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18584-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/7/9/46079_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109312-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109313-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-at-the-begining-of-a-level.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109314-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-picking-up-some-hostages.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109315-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-shooting-at-a-tank.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109316-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-clearing-the-area-of-enemies.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109317-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-hostages-entering-the-home.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109318-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-flying-to-the-next-sector.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109319-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-under-attack-by-ordnance.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109320-choplifter-iii-game-boy-screenshot-in-a-narrow-cave.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2731500-4868288491-mSDC0.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Choplifter II - Rescue &amp;

The levels scroll in all directions and hostages are spread out over the whole area. Your helicopter takes damage from enemies such as planes, birds or ordnance; but also from contact with buildings and hills. To finish a level, you have to rescue a given number of hostages; saving more hostages than required gains you extra points. If you take too much damage, you'll lose a live. For losing too many hostages, you'll instantly lose a continue, regardless of how many lives you have left.

It is the second sequel to the 1982 Apple-II game Choplifter, and follows a similar structure. The player must use their helicopter to collect POWs from horizontally looping stages, emancipating them from their prisons by destroying the walls, evading or eliminating their captors and returning them back to the allied helipad.[CR]Choplifter III was released on the SNES in early 1994. It was soon followed by a Game Boy port.

Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.[CR]UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Sony Electronic Publishing Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>oMWu7CU1a7g</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18608</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585667-chuck-rock</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/chuck-rock</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chuck-rock/3030-2941/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18608-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/7/73970/1288177-chuckrock_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66582-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66583-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-somethings-hiding-in-the-tree.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66584-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-im-hit.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66585-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-a-beasty.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66586-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-brambles-hurt.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66587-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-use-the-water-spout-to-cross.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66588-chuck-rock-game-boy-screenshot-the-bird-picks-you-up.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2614717-chuckrock001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/822850-chuckrock__6_.gif</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/822849-chuckrock__5_.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Cliffhanger (USA, Europe)">		<description>Cliffhanger (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="AA133439" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCliffhanger%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="C74F85035842F8A2D9560066D7065FF86D9107E2" size="101380" />		<title_clean>Cliffhanger</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cliffhanger is a brawler based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie, and the player assumes the role of Sly's character Gabe. As in the movie, Gabe and fellow rescue worker Hal are forced at gunpoint to work with some terrorists to recover deposit boxes filled with cash from the US Treasury that were scattered across the Rocky Mountains.[CR]The 16-bit versions of the game (SNES, Genesis and Sega CD) are brawlers much like Double Dragon or Final Fight. The Sega CD version also includes a fast-paced stage where Gabe tries to outrun an avalanche sledding down a hill, as well as cutscenes taken from the movie. The 8-bit versions (Game Boy, Game Gear, NES) are platformer action games.[CR]Cliffhanger won the award for Worst Movie-To-Game of 1994 by EGM magazine.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Sony Imagesoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<videoid>n1Yfx8sRngw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18587</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585668-cliffhanger</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/cliffhanger_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cliffhanger/3030-4616/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18587-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210290-cliffhanger-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477123-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477228-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477229-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-first-stage.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477230-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-wolves-are-among-the-first.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477231-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-ah-a-warm-fire.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477232-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-that-hurt.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477233-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-brachiating-along-a-line-someone.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/477234-cliffhanger-game-boy-screenshot-rocks-are-falling-down-continuously.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2658288-cliffhanger002.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2658287-cliffhanger001.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Collection Pocket (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Collection Pocket (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="34E62C8B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCollection%20Pocket%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="DAAD5EC53DA0E375CEE3962C0A9031D8A67020FD" size="94714" />		<title_clean>Collection Pocket</title_clean>		<plot>Collection Pocket is a Miscellaneous game, published by Naxat Soft,which was released in Japan in 1997.</plot>		<releasedate>21/11/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Naxat Soft</studio>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/570003-collection-pocket</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/4/5/306445_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/4/5/306445_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/5/e/gfs_9511_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/8/e/gfs_9511_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/3/e/gfs_9511_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/c/3/gfs_9511_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/1/3/gfs_9511_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/a/3/gfs_9511_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/3/gfs_9511_2_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/3/gfs_9511_2_5.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/3/gfs_9511_2_6.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/3/gfs_9511_2_7.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="College Slam (USA)">		<description>College Slam (USA)</description>		<rom crc="A549A572" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCollege%20Slam%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="84DC6269FBE4EE4C157F940B0A9630412E099CC6" size="286711" />		<title_clean>College Slam</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]College Slam is an arcade style basketball game.[CR]Power-Ups![CR]3: Increases your ability to make the three-point outside shot!D: Allows you to perform Monster Jams from anywhere on the court!S: Increases your overall speed to astounding levels!P: Increases your power to a degree you can hardly imagine!T: Provides you with temporary unlimited boost action!F: Causes you to be temporarily "on fire"!B: The bomb knocks over everyone on the court -

It is the second game to star Spot, the tiny anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.[CR]The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.[CR]While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.[CR]In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of "spots" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. "Spots" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.[CR]The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Virgin Interactive Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.9</rating>		<videoid>S4Gb8ATVkz8</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18607</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585671-cool-spot</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/cool-spot</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cool-spot/3030-11746/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18607-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145673-cool-spot-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444201-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444202-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-instructions-sort-of.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68212-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-hop-over-the-barb-wire.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68213-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-a-checkpoint.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68214-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-climb-the-ladders.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68215-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-this-fish-spits.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68216-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-jump-the-nails.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68217-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-when-idle-spot-plays-with-his.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68218-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-a-pesky-moth.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68219-cool-spot-game-boy-screenshot-spiders-crawl-down-from-the-ceiling.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Cool World (USA, Europe)">		<description>Cool World (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="A193C0D0" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCool%20World%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="1919495CC83C4126C90D6CFA2E14427B6364DA3A" size="79436" />		<title_clean>Cool World</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cool World is a platformer/adventure game based on the movie of the same name. The player must navigate Cool World as either cop Frank Harris or cartoonist Jack Deebs (played by Brad Pitt and Gabriel Byrne respectively in the movie), depending on the version, and prevent Holli Would from passing over to the real world.[CR]The game was released on many platforms between 1992-93, around the time the movie was released. Like most licensed movie tie-in games of the era, it was not well received critically.Super Nintendo Version[CR]In the Super Nintendo version the player assumes the role of Jack Deebs and is trying to find a way to escape Cool World and return to the real world. A large part of the gameplay involves solving adventure game puzzles and avoiding the "Popper Police" for as long as possible.

These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.[CR]The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.[CR]This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>18582</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585674-crystal-quest</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/crystal-quest_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/crystal-quest/3030-2027/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18582-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/5/2/32052_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/258892-crystal-quest-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/258893-crystal-quest-game-boy-screenshot-wave-1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/258894-crystal-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-in-action.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/258890-crystal-quest-game-boy-screenshot-i-m-being-destroyed.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/258891-crystal-quest-game-boy-screenshot-high-score-table.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1744322-cq3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/498/545974-930858_20051207_screen001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/498/545971-930858_20051121_screen003.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/498/545970-930858_20051121_screen002.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/498/545969-930858_20051121_screen001.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Cult Jump (Japan)">		<description>Cult Jump (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="943059BA" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCult%20Jump%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="6A67820EF648D2E24C1212079F5CAC43E04CF0BF" size="217195" />		<title_clean>Cult Jump</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cult Jump is an adventure trivia game developed by Sun L and published by Bandai Co. for the Game Boy handheld. It was only released in Japan and features various Weekly Shonen Jump characters like: Taluluto; Son Goku; Kujo Jotaro; Kenshiro; Taison Maeda; Ryotsu Kankichi; Momotaro Tsurugi; among many others from seven different animes.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The king of the JUMP world was imprisoned in a castle far away! It's up to you, the reader of Shonen Jump, to use all of your knowledge of their published works to beat your opponents and rescue the king.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Castle[CR]The game begins with the main character having to climb to the plateau of the castle. The climb consists of five stages (floors) and once up there, he is faced with four towers.[CR]It is possbile to choose any of the towers to start with, each of which presents the same difficulty level. Each tower consists of ten stages, each of them with a boss at the end. The tower will be destroyed once the boss from the last stage has been defeated. After destroying the four towers the player's character has to go down a passageway that opens in the center plateau. Thereafter the descent is made of five stages until a last boss is encountered.[CR]Altogether there are 50 long stages where the player needs to answer the questions posed by the opponents to survive and move on. A password will be displayed after beating each of these stages.[CR]The drive system is very simple, like the other Game Boy RPGs. Each stage consists of several rooms, and in order to move through them, the player must answer correctly the question asked by the door (which has "half heart" so it can be considered as an opponent like others). In each of these rooms it may or may not have an opponent or multiple opponents. These includes: birds, flying boxing gloves, skaters, surfers, a moving hand lifting a weight, octopuses, robots, among other weird creatures. These opponents are remarkably different during the game, each of them behaves in a different way, with different drive system. Some are very slow while others are fast. And for example, some of them chase the character, while others only move horizontally and/or vertically. Most of the time, it is possible to avoid them by making some specific movements. The strength of each of them (amount of life) also varies, they become increasingly stronger as the game progresses, however the system of questions don't vary. A question is always written with alternatives to be answered within a short period of time. Responding properly, a "half heart" damage is given to your opponent, and if the answer is wrong, the player's character will suffer the "half heart" injury. Clearing all the hearts of the opponent will defeat them (sometimes a heart is even "dropped" by them once defeated), and the opposite is true for the player's character, sending the player back to the early stage. When starting the stage again, the doors that were previously opened will remain open.BossesBosses (sports and martial arts creatures, robots, animals...)[CR]The only variation in the system of questions happens when the player faces the stage boss, as his last questions are accompanied by the images of some of the characters who appeared in the pages of Weekly Shonen Jump. These images will appear and it is necessary to answer questions like: "This character belongs to which manga?". They form in few different ways, appearing "point by point", appearing in "bands", appearing in the midst of a "wave" that moves the image, or appears only in a small circle which is moving over the image. The player must answer the question correctly within the given time. Hitting or missing, the image appears immediately and is necessary to answer the next question. It is only here, during the questions of the stage bosses, that we can glimpse the Dragon Ball characters appearing in the game, of which there are ten: Goku, Vegeta, Krillin, Piccolo, Master Roshi, King Kai, Android 18, Dr. Gero, Frieza and Cell.StagesInside the castle[CR]Regarding the stages just a few things worth noting: Some of them contain passages blocked and unblocking them is essential to end the stage. A button must be found that causes an "earthquake" that releases the passages. In about two stages there is no such button, but there is a room with ideograms on the ground and each one makes a different musical note. Then the player needs to be aware because in a room reasonably close you are faced with a "friend" who's gonna pass the correct order of ideograms (the music being played). Draw these ideograms to not forget and once in the room with the ideograms on the ground, it is necessary to pass over them in the correct order. Once done the right combination, the "earthquake" will unlock the passages. There are also some secret passages, but there are so few that are not even worth commenting on them, even more that these passages do not have anything essential to end the stage.ItemsItems[CR]During the game, the player also come across with many "treasure chests" and in every one of these chests, your character acquires one of the eight objects that the game contains. Objects are not cumulative, so if you are "lucky" to find a chest with an object that you already have, you are unable to pick up the object until you spend yours. These objects have different utilities and each has its own characteristics. Remember that they can be used together.[CR]These are:Happy Star[CR]By using it, your character gets an invincibility that allows to automatically eliminate any opponent without having to answer your questions. The effect is temporary and is useless against bosses.Hook[CR]Once inside some of the towers, the hook allows to exit the tower and return to the center of the field with all four towers. In short, if you do not know how to finish a stage (or simply want to search another item in another tower), you can use this trick to think again or try another tower. It does not work if used during the "up" and "descent" of the castle.Pump -1[CR]Once chosen, in all questions that will follow the course of a stage, it automatically eliminates one of the wrong options.Magic Potion[CR]Recovers life "fueling" hearts.Alarm[CR]Once chosen, it makes your character has twice the time to answer the questions that will follow during a phase.Sword Of Fire[CR]Doubles the power of your attack against an opponent, to correctly answer a question. Once selected, it is used in all the questions that will follow during a phase.Map[CR]Not renewable. You have to find one at each stage as your character starts the game without a map. The black square indicates where your character is, the gray indicates the areas that have already been visited and the white indicates somewhere unknown.Ball 2[CR]Allows you to click on any alternative of a quiz, if the alternative chosen is wrong, it will make "PUF" and your character does not lose HP. The other alternatives remain, and if you miss again, then your character takes damage. Once chosen, it is used in all the questions that will follow during a phase.[CR]To use such objects, the player needs access to their screen. At the top is seen the objects that your character has, and moving the cursor over them we have an explanation at the bottom right of what he does. At the bottom left we have in order: the name chosen, the HP of your character and the stage that is being explored.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]In the same year, Bandai published a similar game for the Game Boy, entitled Cult Master: Ultraman ni Miserarete.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>10/9/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Trivia</genre>		<studio>Sun L</studio>		<videoid>5_F2jd59pKo</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569800-cult-jump</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cult-jump/3030-38313/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2204989-cult_jump___game_boy.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/9/8/306298_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205745-54___cult_jump___last_password.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205744-53___cult_jump___the_end.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205743-52___cult_jump___last_boss.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205742-51___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205741-50___cult_jump___password___last_stage.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205740-49___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205739-48___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205738-47___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205737-46___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2205736-45___cult_jump.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Cult Master - Ultraman ni Miserarete (Japan)">		<description>Cult Master - Ultraman ni Miserarete (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="C3EB82EF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCult%20Master%20-%20Ultraman%20ni%20Miserarete%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="F0E63A0A4E7B576C7460E810EB6F50D4C5B68769" size="142206" />		<title_clean>Cult Master - Ultraman ni Miserarete</title_clean>		<plot>Cult Master is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Minato Giken and published by Bandai,which was released in Japan in 1993.</plot>		<releasedate>12/3/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Trivia</genre>		<studio>Minato Giken</studio>		<videoid>MWtAyXrt95M</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569799-cult-master</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cult-master-ultraman-ni-miserarete/3030-49041/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2731375-6941832256-30629.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/9/7/306297_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/1/gfs_7372_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/5/1/gfs_7372_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/1/gfs_7372_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/4/1/gfs_7372_1_5.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/1/c/gfs_7372_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/c/c/gfs_7372_2_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/7/c/gfs_7372_2_3.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/6/c/gfs_7372_2_4.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="CutThroat Island (USA, Europe)">		<description>CutThroat Island (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="EEBDD360" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FCutThroat%20Island%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="5E99EA51B383CDCD53874EB027EBD59D2A3156B9" size="160215" />		<title_clean>CutThroat Island</title_clean>		<plot>In this game you play the role of a pirate lady called Morgan who was given a piece of a map by her father before he died.

The game was developed by Vic Tokai Corporation and published by both Karoshi Corporation (MSX release) and Vic Tokai (Game Boy release).[CR]The MSX version of the game was developed and released in 2006 by Karoshi Corporation as part of the MSXdev'06 competition.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of each level is to completely fill in the area of a shape using only the puzzle pieces provided. These shapes were penominos, like Tetris blocks, and could be rotated in a similar manner. While lacking a modern "save" feature, upon completion of each level, the player was provided with a password they could enter later as a level skip.[CR]Interesting facts[CR]"Daedalian" is taken from the mythical Greek craftsman "Daedalus" who was responsible for contrusting the Labyrinth.The password system was somewhat flawed, in that each password was a guessable four-letter English word.The "ultimate" password that gives access to a level selection screen is "ZEAL". It is revealed upon completion of the final level.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<studio>Vic Tokai</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>2.3</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18611</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585678-daedalian-opus</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/daedalian-opus</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/daedalian-opus/3030-3533/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10673</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18611-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/72675-daedalian-opus-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119923-daedalian-opus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20895-daedalian-opus-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20896-daedalian-opus-game-boy-screenshot-the-mysterious-dr-p.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20897-daedalian-opus-game-boy-screenshot-the-entrance-to-puzzle-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20898-daedalian-opus-game-boy-screenshot-puzzle-1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20899-daedalian-opus-game-boy-screenshot-puzzle-1-solved.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/625629-1169342054_03.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/625628-1169342054_02.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/625627-1169342054_01.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/625626-1169342054_00.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/625625-1169342053_01.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/VfduPFz.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Daffy Duck (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Daffy Duck (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="C47671F3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDaffy%20Duck%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="75B384222D07947BAED2213C288385C4B91E1911" size="73560" />		<title_clean>Daffy Duck</title_clean>		<plot>Get ready to duck and cover.

And I still have laundry to do. Bah! I always was a big fan of wargames though.. And by wargames, I mean Panzer General and Steel Panthers, and that's about it. :) Well this here game doesn't try to look pretty or anything, but it does the job. It's pretty simple: issue your commands in the Map mode (hit Select), and then get out of Map mode and the game plays itself out. Your units do what they're told every turn until the order's carried out, and then they sit there. Get as many cities as you can, because then you get more money. Infantry kills heavy infantry, heavy infantry kills tanks, and tanks kill infantry. More or less, anyway. Dave's done a pretty good job with the translation; quite a professional look to it. Or maybe it's just me. Ah well, it's fun. Oh, and if you get confused, Dave's included a manual in the zip to help you out. YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE.

Platforming stagesShooting gallery stagesDangling Stages The platforming stages are standard. run and jump across obstacles in the environment while avoiding or attacking enemies, until you reach the end of the level. At that point Darkman will either proceed to the next level or face a boss fight, if the player is going up against one of the members of Durant's gang. During the levels where you are attacking one of Durant's crew, Darkman spends part of the level disguised as the boss of the level. Darkman can do the boss' moves, and enemies will not necessarily attack you. However, this disguise only lasts for a limited time, determined by how well the player did on the photography stages.  The shooting gallery stages put you behind a camera, instead of a gun, as you take pictures of the boss of the next stage to build up a disguise. While Darkman cannot be killed on this stage, your performance determines how long Darkman's disguise lasts on the next level.  Dangling stages put Darkman hanging at the end of a rope underneath a helicopter as he's sent through traffic, like in the climactic scene with Durant towards the end of the film. Through this, Darkman can move up and down the rope, and collect power-ups and 1-ups in the environment. However, he can also be killed if he hits too many vehicles.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Ocean Software Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>1260</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585680-darkman</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/darkman</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/darkman/3030-8205/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1260-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1260-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64883-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-darkman-walks-along.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64884-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-and-turns-into-a-shadow-on-the.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64873-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-the-scientist-hard-at-work.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64880-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-the-scientist-is-attacked.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64881-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-not-a-happy-bunny.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64869-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-darkman-seeks-revenge.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64885-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-one-of-durant-s-henchmen.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64886-darkman-game-boy-screenshot-the-henchman-gets-knocked-to-the.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1748219-dm3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1748218-dm2.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1260-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1260-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Darkwing Duck (USA)">		<description>Darkwing Duck (USA)</description>		<rom crc="238B9646" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDarkwing%20Duck%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="CC1F12F3EC3852657A14D11C13D1EF91FBDDA5BB" size="84164" />		<title_clean>Darkwing Duck</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The forest[CR]Darkwing Duck is another one of many collaborations between  Disney and  Capcom ( DuckTales,  Rescue Rangers,  Aladdin ect.) that had a golden era in the early to mid '90s. It's based of the Disney cartoon with the same name and features St.Canards dark superhero  Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard.[CR]The setting is pretty dark and can be compared to that of  Batman but with a lot of satire and humor thrown in. Darkwing Duck was inspired by a couple of specific  DuckTales episodes and both Launchpad McQuack and Gizmo Duck appears in both series, the first one being a returning character in Duck Tales. A total of three seasons were made of the cartoon series with a total of 91 episodes.[CR]The first release of the game was for the NES in 1992 and it was followed up by a Game Boy release a year later, in 1993.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]I am Darkwing Duck![CR]The game plays pretty much like Capcom's classic super hit series  Mega Man. It's an  action-platformer for the NES where players can  jump and shoot.[CR]Platforming can often be very challenging and if the player should die they have to start back at the beginning of the stage. Many would claim that Darkwing is almost a direct copy of Mega Man with many stages having similar themes and similar graphical design when compared to Mega Man or Mega Man 2 stages.[CR]At the end of every stage a  boss from the cartoon awaits which is often designed as a puzzle players must work out to defeat. The stages are selected from a overview  map of the city and they range from the heart of town to the outskirts.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Capcom Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<videoid>MVT12M9vNTM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18815</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/197058-disneys-darkwing-duck</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/darkwing-duck</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/darkwing-duck/3030-20169/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2361637-nes_darkwingduck.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/116414-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/212431-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56724-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/151274-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/68412-disney-s-darkwing-duck-nes-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/229481-disney-s-darkwing-duck-nes-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60450-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60451-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60452-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-more-intro.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60453-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-where-should-we.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60454-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-in-the-sewers.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60455-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-he-is-egg-proof.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60456-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-kill-him-darkwing.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60457-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-duck-super-hero.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60458-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-he-can-t-fly.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60459-disney-s-darkwing-duck-game-boy-screenshot-not-so-loud-they.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="David Crane's The Rescue of Princess Blobette Starring A Boy and His Blob (USA)">		<description>David Crane's The Rescue of Princess Blobette Starring A Boy and His Blob (USA)</description>		<rom crc="8210A03F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDavid%20Crane%27s%20The%20Rescue%20of%20Princess%20Blobette%20Starring%20A%20Boy%20and%20His%20Blob%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="0A45D1B98646FD7832B5119B04BC8D6D6D0F657A" size="39727" />		<title_clean>David Crane's The Rescue of Princess Blobette Starring A Boy and His Blob</title_clean>		<plot>Blob is Back!That's right, the jelly bean-loving Blob and his faithful Earth-boy companion are back in a brand-new adventure!

If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. [CR]You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.[CR]From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.[CR]The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Simulation</genre>		<studio>Mindscape</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>18613</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585681-days-of-thunder</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/days-of-thunder</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/days-of-thunder/3030-9537/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18613-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/8/29138_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70836-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70837-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-pre-race-options.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70838-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-practice-how-fast-you-can.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70839-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-tyre-wear-indicator.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70840-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-damage-indicator.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70841-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-stay-on-the-track.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70842-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-qualifying-positions.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70843-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-starting-off-the-real-racing.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70844-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-other-cars-can-get-smashed.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70845-days-of-thunder-game-boy-screenshot-different-colored-cars.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Dead Heat Scramble (USA)">		<description>Dead Heat Scramble (USA)</description>		<rom crc="9E3E3656" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDead%20Heat%20Scramble%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="71E560DD2B5F5C4F4DCCA0837C74BB1B843A15AA" size="36098" />		<title_clean>Dead Heat Scramble</title_clean>		<plot>Dead Heat Scramble is a Racing game, developed by Toei Animation and published by Electro Brain, which was released in 1990.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/585682.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]From the title screen, press the B button eight times, then the A button eight times, and then again the B button the same number of levels you want to skip.

The movie itself is based on the Hank Ketcham syndicated comic strip of a tearaway child, his family and friends and his irascible elderly neighbor Mr. Wilson whom Dennis is constantly tormenting. In Europe the game (and movie) is known as Dennis to help keep it separate from the UK property named Dennis the Menace, the mascot of The Beano.[CR]The game is a straightforward platformer. Dennis wanders around a number of locations, including a forest and Mr Wilson's house. He has a limited amount of time to recover Mr. Wilson's stolen coin collection and reach the next stage. His end goal is to defeat Switchblade Sam, the antagonist of the movie, and rescue his friends Joey and Margaret.[CR]The game was released on the Super Nintendo and Game Boy in the US and Europe.

The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.[CR]Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the "Madman" himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.[CR]There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.[CR]Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Malibu

NES game of the same name. Based on the Dick Tracy franchise, the game picks up after the end of the NES game, with Big Boy breaking out of prison and plotting his revenge on Tracy. Eschewing the open world and investigation aspects of its predecessor, this game offers a simpler, more linear experience, focused on action and platforming.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game starts some time after the Dick Tracy NES game, with The City at peace as mob kingpin Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice is locked away in the state penitentiary after Tracy got him on the hook for bank robbery. It proves short lived though, as Big Boy escapes and a crime wave is unleashed upon its streets. Determined to restore order and put Big Boy back behind bars, Tracy goes after Shoulders, the last person to visit him in prison. The detective finds Shoulders trying to dispose of a photo showing The Brow facilitating the escape, and wastes no time heading for the henchman's train yard hideout.[CR]At the yard, he finds another photo, this time of Big Boy robbing a safe, and corners The Brow demanding some answers. The Brow claims the photos were all taken by Pruneface, who was blackmailing them. And ominously, he suggests there are more photos, some of which should worry Tracy himself. Mulling over the mobsters words, Tracy heads to the Harbor to track down the blackmailer.[CR]Prunceface readily admits to the deed, but gives Tracy something else to think about with a photo of hitman Flattop at the Club Ritz... together with Tracy's true love Tess Trueheart. Worried, Tracy rushes to the Ritz. As he corners Flattop, the gangster gloats as Tracy sees the final photo - Big Boy posing with a captured Tess - and reveals it was all a ruse to lure him into a trap.[CR]Now faced with with the full force of Big Boy's gang, Tracy fights his way to the drawbridge gearhouse the kingpin is holding Tess in. After a long battle, Tracy is victorious, and Big Boy breaks down in front of him, offering riches and pleading for mercy. Furious, Tracy instead sends him flying into the river. The game ends with Tess and Tracy embracing under the moonlight, and Tess suggesting the two go out for chili.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Game Boy Dick Tracy is a linear side-scrolling action platformer. Lacking the open world and investigation aspects of the NES game, it instead offers more complex level design due to the addition of vertical scrolling. It keeps the inventory system of its predecessor, but as items are far more common, resource management is rarely an issue. Other changes that contribute to a generally lower degree of difficulty include extra lives and frequent checkpoints, unlimited continues, and no penalties for shooting unarmed opponents.[CR]A mechanic new to the game is the collection of photo pieces, heavily tied in to the game's storyline. There are 12 of them in each levels except the last, both hidden in the environment and dropped by enemies. Once Tracy has defeated the level's boss, he 2 minutes to piece them together, and can gain extra health, bonus time and additional lives depending on how many pieces are in their correct place.[CR]Tracy starts out with 5 hearts of health and 3 lives. He can pick up items found in the open, hidden inside crates or dropped from enemies, including hearts, hand guns, tommy guns, tear gas and grenades.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game has 5 levels, with 3 to 4 areas each. Each level has a time limit, which can be extended by picking up clock items placed throughout the game.LevelEnvironmentBoss1-1Streets1-2Residence1-3Sewer1-4SewerShoulders2-1Industrial2-2Train Yard2-3Train YardThe Brow3-1Harbor3-2Sewer3-3SewerPruneface4-1Club Ritz4-2Backstage4-3BackstageFlattop5-1Harbor5-2Industrial5-3Gearhouse5-4GearhouseBig Boy[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Bandai America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18618</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585687-dick-tracy</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/dick-tracy___</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dick-tracy/3030-40473/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18618-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/3/2/24832_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178890-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178891-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-from-the-opening-movie-jailbreak.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178892-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-catching-big-boy-is-the-object.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178893-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-punching-a-thug-on-the-street.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178894-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-people-will-throw-safes-out.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178895-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-climbing-a-ladder.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178896-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-finding-a-gun.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178897-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-you-can-stand-on-window-sills.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178899-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-point-blank-shoot-out.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178902-dick-tracy-game-boy-screenshot-there-are-a-lot-of-platforming.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Dig Dug (USA)">		<description>Dig Dug (USA)</description>		<rom crc="6C742478" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDig%20Dug%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="951753904389332412D4B0A80B48D7AC61A494FC" size="58639" />		<title_clean>Dig Dug</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  View zoomed image in  gallery for animation.     You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as    Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs    underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath    boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a    "kill screen" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,    Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :    Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),    Eggplant,  Green Pepper,    Tomato,    Garlic,    Watermelon,    Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco's    Galaxian.     [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will  face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through  the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle.  FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many    sequels and has appeared on many    compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the    Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth.  Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.  They stated, "...the game play is intact and the graphics are decent for GB standards.  A few new features [are] thrown in for a little variety and you have a solid little GB cart that's great for long road trips".[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Namco

In addition to featuring the first four levels from the original arcade game, this new adventure goes on to feature eight additional worlds that add an entirely new form of gameplay to the the original story of Mario rescuing Pauline from Donkey Kong. Where before Mario simply had to reach the top of the stage, he now found himself forced to chase Donkey Kong for miles and miles across varying locations and past dozens of identical locked doors sitting mysteriously out in the open. Eventually, Donkey Kong Jr. will join into the fray.

Mario's goal is to drag a key to a locked door. He must accomplish this task by outwitting enemies and finding his way past obstacles while holding onto the key. The key will disappear and return to it's starting point if he lets go of it for too long. Mario is much more acrobatic, being able to jump, do handstands, perform a triple-jump, and perform backwards somersaults. In this version Mario can only be hit once before he dies, although taking a hit from an enemy will only result in Mario being stunned for a moment. Mario does not have the ability to fall infinite distances in this game, if he plummets too far and lands on a solid surface, he will strike his head and die on impact. There are no powerups in this game, Mario's abilities at the start are the same as the abilities he has at the end. However, there are extra lives scattered throughout many stages, and a hat, parasol, and handbag hidden in every stage that has a key.

Like the first DKC, players control  Donkey Kong and  Diddy Kong as while travelling through jungles, caves, construction sites, and more. Most of the same enemies from DKC are in this spin-off, even though there are different levels and different bosses.Two animal companions feature in the game:  Rambi and  Expresso. Due to the Game Boy's limitations, only one character is shown on the character screen, instead of two; players can switch characters by pressing the select button. Its save feature is also different from Donkey Kong Country - in order to be able to save, players must have collected all four KONG letters or beaten the boss in the previous level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Enter the following codes on the file select screen, while highlighting the designated save file to use the cheats in.

Compared to the first  DKL title, DKL2 shares more in common to  Donkey Kong Country 2; it keeps the same storyline, worlds and level names, although the design and structure of the levels themselves has been changed so the game is not just a watered down port. The team-up mechanic which was introduced in DKC2 is missing here due to the Game Boy's limitations, but the Kongs' signature moves like Diddy's cartwheel and Dixie's helicopter spin have still been included, as have their animal buddies which still retain their charge-up "super moves" introduced in Donkey Kong Country 2.Compared to the original, Donkey Kong Land 2 has smoother control and better proportioned sprites, but the level of detail with the visuals has been cut down, particularly with the sprites which seem to tear every now and then while playing.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Gangplank Galleon Pirate PanicMainbrace MayhemGangplank GalleyLockjaw's LockerTopsail TroubleKrow's Nest (Boss)Krem CauldronHot Head HopKannon's KlaimLava LagoonRedhot RideSquawks's ShaftBarrel BayouGlimmer's GalleonKrockhead KlamberRattle BattleSlime ClimbKleaver's Kiln (Boss)Krazy KremlandHornet HoleTarget TerrorBramble BlastRickety RaceBramble ScrambleMudhole MarshRambi RumbleKing Zing Sting (Boss)Gloomy GulchGhostly GroveKrazy KoasterGusty GladeParrot Chute PanicWeb WoodsKreepy Krow (Boss)K.Rool's KeepArctic AbyssWindy WellDungeon DangerClapper's CavernChain Link ChamberToxic TowerStronghold ShowdownThe Flying Krock Screech's SprintK. Rool Duel (Boss)The Lost World (Klubba's Kiosk)Jungle JinxBlack Ice BattleFiery FurnaceKlobber KarnageAnimal AnticsKrocodile Kore (Boss)[CR]Differences to Donkey Kong Country 2[CR]Overworld map has been flipped, as have most of the individual world maps. Crocodile Cauldron and  Krem Quay have been joined together to create Krem Cauldron; some of their levels have been transferred to Krazy Kremland. As a result the boss of Krem Quay in DKC2,  Kudgel, does not make an appearance in this game.Lost World is accessed as an entire world from the overworld map, instead of having individual levels accessed from each of the worlds via Klubba's Kiosk.Removal of Swanky and  Cranky,  Wrinkly no longer gives out hints.No team-up mechanic present.Characters always transform into Animal buddies and cannot ride them.Dixie's ponytail whirl now allows the player to hit B in the air at any time before hitting the peak of their jump.While stages may have the same name as their SNES console counterparts, the level layout (and sometimes mechanics) are completely different.End of a level is marked by a stand-alone target with no prizes for good timing.Stages with water in them do not have dynamic water which raises and falls anymore.Not all music has been ported over, as such many of the different level archtypes share the same music.Music has been remixed by  Grant Kirkhope (composer for Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata) rather than by original composer  David Wise.No bonus stages are accessed via cannons with cannon balls, or by breaking through secret walls. All are found in bonus barrels.Only 47 Bonus or Krem Coins to collect instead of 75.Cat O' Nine Tails enemy has been removed.Glimmer's Galleon no longer features the angler fish Glimmer; instead players must touch various barrels to light up the stage.It's possible to complete the Rattle Battle stage without using Rattly the snake at all.Slime Climb features toxic slime which hurts the player upon touching it instead of containing a dangerous piranha (Snapjaw in Donkey Kong Country 2).Kleaver's Kiln fight utilises Krockheads that the player must use to cross to the other side of the battlefield instead of hooks.Haunted Hall in  Gloomy Gulch has been replaced by a regular rollercoaster level called Krazy Koaster.Only need to scale one set of rigging ropes in Kreepy Krow fight.In King Zing Sting fight, King Zing never shoots barbs. It doesn't matter where players hit him with  Squawks the Parrot's nuts, and he won't make a barricade of Zingers around himself, only leave a trail of them behind him later in the fight instead.Animal Antics is now entirely a jungle level.K. Rool Duel is now set in a castle level, whereas Krocodile Kore fight is now set in a lava level.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.7</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>-nz5FuDqgXk</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3176</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/197138-donkey-kong-land-2</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/donkey-kong-land-2</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-land-2/3030-9722/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8017</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3948/1167190-197138_27868_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/A8YOwUJ.png</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69597-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111537-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172270-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57952-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/233603-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254323-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254320-donkey-kong-land-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart9>		<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/256107-donkey-kong-land-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart10>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3176-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3176-2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3176-3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21898-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-titlescreen.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104793-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-has-3-empty.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21899-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-going-for-a-ride.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21900-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-world-map.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21901-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-pirate-ship.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21902-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-krem-cauldron.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21903-donkey-kong-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-hornet-s-nest.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3176-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3176-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3176-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3176-4.jpg</fanart4>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/05Qmm8h.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Donkey Kong Land III (USA, Europe) (Rev A) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Donkey Kong Land III (USA, Europe) (Rev A) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="A19ACDB6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDonkey%20Kong%20Land%20III%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28Rev%20A%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="A6CE883727212E1AFB45B48431A46CFBC6F7F6EF" size="385642" />		<title_clean>Donkey Kong Land III</title_clean>		<plot>DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost World after hearing of a contest to find it on the radio.

The game was first developed by Technos Japan Corporation and published by Taito Corporation, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular Double Dragon franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two Neo-Geo fighting games.[CR]After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 (two different versions), PC, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari Lynx, Xbox Live Arcade, Zeebo, iPhone and Android. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the Game Gear, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.[CR]The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the Shadow Master).[CR]The game's soundtrack was composed by Kazunaka Yamane, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.Gameplay[CR]Double Dragon follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version[CR]A three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).[CR]In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).[CR]Other Versions[CR]NES VersionOnly two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version[CR]Released in 1988 (and later on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by Tradewest, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, Billy Lee faces off against his brother, Jimmy Lee.[CR]Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.The two player fighting mode in NES version[CR]The game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).[CR]There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.Master System VersionSega Master System home console port of Double Dragon[CR]After the NES version was released, Sega brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the Sega Master System's more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.[CR]Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).Mega Drive/Genesis Version[CR]In 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.Handheld VersionsThe Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character[CR]The game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.[CR]The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.[CR]On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.[CR]With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.[CR]In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of Double Dragon Advance, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.Smartphone VersionSmartphone version[CR]In 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.Other Versions[CR]Like the sequels to Double Dragon, Binary Designs worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by Ocean Software, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.[CR]The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision[CR]Both of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.[CR]Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by Activision. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.SoundtrackOpening (Double Dragon)The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)After the BattleSetting Off (A New Battle)The WoodsThe Giant Abobo AppearsThe Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)Ending (Reunion With Marian)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created. One for the CPC 6128 hardware, which was very well-received and released almost exclusively in France, and another version created for the CPC 464 which was universally panned.The more well-received version of Double Dragon on the Amstrad CPC actually had more in common with the Atari ST and Amiga versions.An advertising campaign from Data East around the release of Bad Dudes stated that, "Bad Dudes Makes Double Dragon Pale by Comparison."Most versions of Double Dragon are infamous for their glitches and exploits, such as suicidal enemies, weapons that can be carried to future stages, frozen sprites, incorrect graphics, and even walking up walls or in the air.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Tradewest</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<videoid>3O9SwMUhJT4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3177</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/197144-double-dragon</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/double-dragon</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/double-dragon/3030-20752/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3177-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3177-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48168-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/193954-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282044-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26782-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26783-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-publisher-developer.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26784-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-hey-bring-back-maria.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26785-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-baseball-bat-justice.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26786-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-pits-are-crucial-to-taking.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26787-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-abobo-smash-you-good.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26789-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-tricky-jumps-in-level-2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26790-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-level-3-looks-familiar.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26791-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-scale-the-cliff-for-the-final.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/139866/2708120-032210.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3177-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3177-g.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3177.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Double Dragon 3 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe)">		<description>Double Dragon 3 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="FC970AEF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDouble%20Dragon%203%20-%20The%20Arcade%20Game%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="C596D069D9FBD6372757E5D669A5144E2EB9D8FF" size="75288" />		<title_clean>Double Dragon 3 - The Arcade Game</title_clean>		<plot>The original martial arts adventure continues - all the hard-hitting arcade action is at your command!

Rather than porting the arcade game to the Game Boy, as with Double Dragon and Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones, Technos chose to adapt the Japanese brawler Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun: Bangai Rountouhen (a game in the same franchise as Renegade and River City Ransom) into a Double Dragon game.Double Dragon II on the Game Boy; a localized version of a Japan only beat-em-up[CR]In this version of the game, players control Billy Lee, being hunted by the Scorpions (a gang; Billy has been framed for killing one of their members). After fighting various members of the Scorpions, Billy faces off against the real murderer, Anderson. Featuring cooperative play through a Game Boy Link Cable, a second player can play as Jimmy Lee.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the Game Boy version of Double Dragon. Players can punch, kick, and kneel (by pressing both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously). After kneeling down, the character can perform a special jump uppercut by hitting either of the buttons. Additionally, players can grab enemies and then throw them. Unlike other versions of Double Dragon II, the Game Boy game has a total of eleven levels spanning across three stages (although the eleventh level is only available on Normal or Hard; not Easy).[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Beat-Em-Up</genre>		<studio>Acclaim</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<videoid>gf9EwVNk_Co</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13065</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563268-double-dragon-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/double-dragon</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/double-dragon-ii/3030-5423/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13065-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206727-double-dragon-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48168-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/193954-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282044-double-dragon-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26782-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26783-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-publisher-developer.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26784-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-hey-bring-back-maria.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26785-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-baseball-bat-justice.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26786-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-pits-are-crucial-to-taking.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26787-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-abobo-smash-you-good.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26789-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-tricky-jumps-in-level-2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26790-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-level-3-looks-familiar.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/26791-double-dragon-game-boy-screenshot-scale-the-cliff-for-the-final.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/1734688-dd2gb15.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Double Dribble - 5 on 5 (USA)">		<description>Double Dribble - 5 on 5 (USA)</description>		<rom crc="EE28749D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDouble%20Dribble%20-%205%20on%205%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="D0F18C97B48DD8B355D195D2DDAEEE910C5FC2B1" size="67439" />		<title_clean>Double Dribble - 5 on 5</title_clean>		<plot>Based on the arcade game, Double Dribble is a basketball action game for one or two players.

Monster, who must explore Dr. Frankenstein's castle in order to recover pieces of his girlfriend Bitsy and reassemble her. Franky eventually ends up travelling all over the world to find the remaining pieces.[CR]Dr Franken was originally developed by Motivetime and published by Elite Systems on the Game Boy in 1992. It was ported to the Super Nintendo the following year. In the US, the SNES version is known as The Adventures of Dr Franken. The SNES PAL box art still calls the game Dr. Franken, though the in-game title screen refers to it by its new extended name.[CR]Versions for the NES and Game Gear were also developed but never commercially released. The game was followed up with a Game Boy only sequel, Dr. Franken II, in 1997.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dr. Franken is a 2D platformer featuring a complex map that requires the player to jump onto various objects and use stairs in order to navigate. Various parts of the castle are also blocked off until the player collects the proper items that will open up specific areas. The game features a map that displays Franky's position in all areas save for the castle's lowest level, which is an underground labyrinth.[CR]Along the way, Franky must contend with numerous enemies and traps that must either be fought or avoided. Franky is able to deal damage using an electrical attack, though most of the game's enemies either come back to life or cannot be killed. The castle contains an electricity-charging machine capable of restoring Franky's life energy should he take too much damage from enemies.[CR]Game progress is saved using a password system.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 7,7,6,6 and 7. Mike Weigand wrote, "This is a good, almost non-linear game involving Frankenstein with a pair of shades and some devastating attacks as he travels around the globe. The graphics are very cute and the animations provide plenty of laughs".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter these on the password screen, when you select &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot;.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Kotobuki System Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>2.8</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18620</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563269-dr-franken</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/dr-franken</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dr-franken/3030-12707/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/7/72557/1342106-game_boy_original_dr_franken_box_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224550-dr-franken-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48167-dr-franken-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224551-dr-franken-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60490-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60491-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-helpful-map.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60492-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-dr-franken-i-presume.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60493-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-i-can-shot-electricity.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60494-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-behold-my-power-jump.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60495-dr-franken-game-boy-screenshot-duck-and-cover-won-t-save-me.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2677767-adventures+of+dr.+franken%2C+the+%28u%29_00000.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2677766-drfranken001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2677765-adventures+of+dr.+franken%2C+the+%28u%29_00001.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2677764-adventures+of+dr.+franken%2C+the+%28u%29_00002.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Dr. Franken II (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv)">		<description>Dr. Franken II (USA, Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv)</description>		<rom crc="0D62473D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDr.%20Franken%20II%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%2CNl%2CSv%29.zip" sha1="8D578CE74907131114279854A0DC376F4426120C" size="182484" />		<title_clean>Dr. Franken II</title_clean>		<plot>It is several years after the death of Dr. Von Frankenbone, and things around the castle are starting to fall apart.

/>		<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.[CR]Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.[CR]The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.[CR]In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.[CR]An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/2001</releasedate>		<year>2001</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Capcom</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18816</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585694-dragons-lair-the-legend</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dragons-lair/3030-23/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5135</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18816-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/3/7/11937_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2624114-dragon%27s+magic+%28j%29_00000.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2624113-dragon%27s+lair+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00003.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2624112-dragon%27s+lair+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00002.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2624111-dragon%27s+lair+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00001.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2624110-dragon%27s+lair+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_00000.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/3/0/gfs_3383_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/0/gfs_3383_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/0/gfs_3383_1_3.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/4/0/gfs_3383_1_4.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/a/d/gfs_3383_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Dragon's Lair - The Legend (USA)">		<description>Dragon's Lair - The Legend (USA)</description>		<rom crc="7A38B5C3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDragon%27s%20Lair%20-%20The%20Legend%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="4E947908FDE7EF9892C59021C6EEA0607771F6D2" size="84820" />		<title_clean>Dragon's Lair - The Legend</title_clean>		<plot>The Game Boy version for Dragon's Lair is actually a port of Roller Coaster, with its protagonist replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all "lifestones" scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy's screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms.[CR]Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.</plot>		<releasedate>14/1/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>CSG Imagesoft Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>1.9</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18816</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585694-dragons-lair-the-legend</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/dragons-lair-the-legend</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18816-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/3/7/11937_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338895-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338897-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338898-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-player-1-splash.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338899-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-here-goes-dirk.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338900-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-would-you-imagine.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338902-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-here-dirk-rides.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338903-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-dirk-must-now.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338904-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-whenever-you.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338905-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-do-not-fear-the.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/338906-dragon-s-lair-the-legend-game-boy-screenshot-what-is-a-medieval.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="DragonHeart (USA, Europe)">		<description>DragonHeart (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="5129A518" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDragonHeart%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="1800CEEBA6ED491E5F85997C945AB52B09F6E4BA" size="310851" />		<title_clean>DragonHeart</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]DragonHeart is a role-playing game developed by Torus Games and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Game Boy platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]DragonHeart is played in a first person view outside of battles.

It was first released in the United States in 1989, making its way to Europe and Japan a year later. It is loosely based on the animated TV show of the same name, following Scrooge on another globehopping adventure.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Booooiiinnggg!!![CR]As anyone familiar with the Disney television series of the same name will be able to tell you, Scrooge McDuck is one rich bird. Not one to shy away from public displays of outlandish opulence, he enjoys nothing more than swimming in huge great piles of jewelry and gold coins, diving into his hoarded treasures with glee. One might imagine that Scrooge would be content to simply wile away the hours wallowing in his accumulated fortune, but this is one duck whose thirst for coinage simply will not be sated, and he spends his time during the game travelling to various exotic locations around the globe in an effort to become even wealthier. The various places that he goes to, which can be played in any order, include Transylvania, The Amazon, The Moon, African Mines and The Himalayas, each with their own distinct music, enemies and graphical presentation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls Scrooge McDuck as he traverses the five areas of the game on his search for more money. Scrooge cannot touch or jump on the enemies without losing health, and so he must rely on his trusty walking stick which he uses to pogo on top of enemies' heads, and to collect treasure and items that he finds locked up in little floating treasure chests scattered around the world. This unique take on the standard "jump on heads" gameplay mechanic is one of the game's most distinctive features, and encouraged many players to forego the act of walking entirely as pogoing is generally faster and leaping off an enemy increases the height of the jump, allowing the player to reach new areas. Scrooge can also use his impressive pogoing ablities to get past nefarious spikes and other hazards, keeping his fragile webbed feet away from danger as his cane does all the work.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Scrooge McDuck - The player controls Scrooge throughout the game, making use of a variety of techniques, while collecting different items.Huey, Dewey and Louie - Donald's nephews pop up in various spots in the game, usually to offer hints or to restrict areas (e.g. in the Moon level) Scrooge does not yet have access to.Webby Vanderquack - Serves a similar function as Scrooge's nephews.Gizmo Duck - Briefly appears to blast a wall open.Launchpad McQuack - Helps Scrooge over a pitfall in the Amazon. Also, he is found in every level (except Transylvania) where the player has the option of letting him take them back to Duckburg. If certain conditions are met, the player will enter a bonus round. Launchpad can be used only once per level.Gyro Gearloose - Shows up only in the bonus level, where he will launch diamonds at Scrooge.Mrs. Beakley - Appears in certain levels where she will drop life-regenerating food to Scrooge.Bubba - If he is released from the ice in the Himalayas, he will reward Scrooge with an extra energy slot.Magica De Spell - Scrooge fights this recurring sorceress enemy in Transylvania.Flintheart Glomgold - Scrooge must stop his rival Flintheart from reaching the treasure before he can.The Beagle Boys - The Beagle Boys show up occasionally, usually as guards of a passage or have taken Scrooge's nephews captive.[CR]Alternate Endings[CR]DuckTales contains a special ending shown when the player finishes the game with at least $10,000,000 and has found both hidden treasures. The alternate ending shows the same newspaper from the normal ending except the picture shows Scrooge McDuck with a crown on his head. The paper states that he "stunned the world with his discovery of 2 lost treasures".[CR]Another ending, far more difficult to manage, involves completing the game with $0 in Scrooge's bank account. The ending newspaper notes that, while he's found the treasures, Scrooge is sad that his fortune has vanished while he was away.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>1/11/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Capcom Co.,Capcom U.S.A.,Disney Interactive</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<videoid>id9RhqA_Tq4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2890</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/197170-disneys-ducktales</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/disneys-ducktales</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ducktales/3030-15799/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7183</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2325927-nes_ducktales.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2890-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66953-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183277-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186005-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55360-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144973-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144974-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-screenshot-selecting-the-first.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144975-disney-s-ducktales-game-boy-screenshot-the-transylvania-stage.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934914-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_32_25_67.png</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934913-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_31_35_00.png</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934912-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_31_27_55.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934911-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_28_21_70.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934910-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_24_37_05.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934909-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_23_40_89.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/934908-nestopia_2009_03_17_21_19_28_89.png</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2890-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/5cijJ0x.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="DuckTales 2 (USA)">		<description>DuckTales 2 (USA)</description>		<rom crc="B151509D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FDuckTales%202%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="C9D5B7A71BADCC7B198897B4888482F663F03504" size="83078" />		<title_clean>DuckTales 2</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]A sequel to the original DuckTales NES game. Similar to the original, the player assumes the role of Scrooge McDuck once again, going through several platforming oriented levels and defeating enemies in hopes of collecting hidden treasure map pieces.[CR]Unlike the original game this sold poorly. The game only saw a limited production run due to its late release in the NES's cycle. The actual gameplay was praised mainly because the game didn't change much from its predecessor.

The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.[CR]Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.[CR]The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, "New Junk City". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blaster[CR]Jim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.[CR]Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping.[CR]Planets[CR]New Junk CIty[CR]Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck.Andy Asteroids?[CR]Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way.Psy-Crow[CR]A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue.What The Heck?[CR]Planet heck is a strange hell-type planet. This is where Evil the Cat lives and where the player must defeat the likes of lawyers and an un-meltable snowman. The player must complete the level while listening to horrifying elevator music.Down the Tubes[CR]Down the Tubes is an underwater level in which Jim must ride giant hamsters, knock over Bob the Killer GoldFish and complete the infamous tube race.Snot a problem[CR]Major Mucus is out to get Jim! Compete with him in a 3 round battle in which Jim and him both bungee jump down to infested waters and fight by swinging into each other and seeing which cord breaks first.Level 5[CR]The 5th level takes place in Professor Monkey for a head's lab. Watch out though, Jim may just lose his suit, make sure to get it back.Who Turned Out The Lights?[CR]A hidden area found in Level 5 which is completely blacked out besides spotlights, the enemies' eyes and doors.For Pete's Sake[CR]Jim has to escort a cute, tiny puppy named Peter through a level that consists of holes, tentacles and meteor showers.

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.[CR]Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:[CR]1. Shooting them with his gun.[CR]2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.[CR]3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.[CR]4. Crushing them with an elevator.[CR]Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.[CR]While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. [CR]Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.[CR]Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.[CR]If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Items[CR]When opening ? marked doors, the item you get is determined by the hundreds digit of your score.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.9</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18622</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585695-elevator-action</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/elevator-action</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/elevator-action/3030-8179/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13502</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18622-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224542-elevator-action-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/193851-elevator-action-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102248-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102249-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-entering-a-building.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102250-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-inside-the-building.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102251-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-your-enemy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102252-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-riding-the-elevator.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102253-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-jumping.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102254-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-dimmed-the-lights.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102255-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-entering-a-door-with-some.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102256-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-got-all-the-documents.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/102257-elevator-action-game-boy-screenshot-heaps-of-elevator-shafts.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/xL0pxI2.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Elite Soccer (USA) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Elite Soccer (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="F54158A6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FElite%20Soccer%20%28USA%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="4576881EA25E29EBBA91C49C89F8E70E105FBC60" size="77561" />		<title_clean>Elite Soccer</title_clean>		<plot>Elite Soccer lets the player choose from 24 National teams including the U.S., England, France, Brazil among others, in a chance to play in the World Cup tournament and win the coveted trophy.  Players can also choose to play in a Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead play one game and advance to the next like a regular tournament.  There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.[CR]The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks.  The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice.  They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors.  Players can also edit their players including appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Simulation, Sports</genre>		<studio>GameTek</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21612</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585696-elite-soccer</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/elite-soccer</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/elite-soccer/3030-31116/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21612-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/188258-elite-soccer-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/188259-elite-soccer-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429504-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429505-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese-version.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429506-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429507-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-country-to-play.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429508-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-game-play-menu.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429509-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-ready-for-the-kick-off.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429510-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-he-s-running-the-ball-down.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429511-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-he-fouled-me-so-i-get-a-free.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429512-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-gooooooal.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429513-elite-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-a-throw-in.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Extra Bases!

It was also often packaged with the Nintendo Game Boy four player adapter, which allowed up to four Game Boys to be connected together via the adapter and three additional link cables.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Control Demo[CR]During the demo, press A or B to speed up the car.</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1991</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1-4 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<videoid>puPPNaw0PKo</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3180</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563271-f-1-race</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/f-1-race</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/f-1-race/3030-16283/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/783172-1ff70ab819f1bcc3da42d3f71e6f480e.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3180-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30301-f-1-race-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/116135-f-1-race-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172267-f-1-race-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183162-f-1-race-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20582-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20583-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-the-world-map.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20584-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-select-machine.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20585-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-starting-line.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20586-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-rounding-the-corner.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20587-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-portugal.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104187-f-1-race-game-boy-screenshot-toad-in-a-f-1-game-yes-it-s-true.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4018/277044-samus.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4018/277042-pit.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4018/277039-peach.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3180-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="F-1 Spirit (Japan)">		<description>F-1 Spirit (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="F9E08783" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FF-1%20Spirit%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="4F950151001C2C7E157BC407601D9A8EB9D2523C" size="82424" />		<title_clean>F-1 Spirit</title_clean>		<plot>F-1 Spirit is the first portable version of Konami's classic MSX top-down racer. It features three classes of open-wheel cars (which dub as difficulty levels), three game modes (practice, single race and championship) and 25 different tracks all around the world, with some of them only playable on the according championship, from the Japanese Formula 3 to the World F1 Grand Prix. On each class, tracks become longer (forcing pit stops), cars faster, and turns change from simple, low angle corners which require no more than a slight trajectory to elbow corners which require some skill to turn without losing speed. [CR]Controls are simple, with the directional button steering the car and the B button used to throttle the car and A to change between high and low gear.</plot>		<releasedate>28/2/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Konami Industry Co.

/>		<title_clean>Faceball 2000</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The November 1991 issue of Nintendo Power where Faceball 2000 was reviewed.[CR]Faceball 2000 is a first-person shooter developed by Xanth Software and published by Bullet Proof Software for the Game Boy on December 10, 1991 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on September 1992. Based on MIDI Maze for the Atari ST, Bullet Proof Software acquired the console publishing rights to the game and released the game in America, Europe and Japan. Players move around a mazed arena as giant floating happy faces, shooting large orbs at enemies to "tag them out". The game was also published for the Game Gear in Japan on December 17, 1993 by Riverhill Software. The Game Boy and Game Gear versions featured local multiplayer via the use of link cables (up to sixteen players on the Game Boy version and two players on the Game Gear version), while the SNES version featured two-player split-screen multiplayer. The four player link cable, which was only packed in with Nintendo&#8217;s F1-race, was necessary for playing the multiplayer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level of Cyberzone mode.[CR]The game is a first-person shooter, where the player controls a floating head inside of a giant maze. The goal is to eliminate enemy heads by shooting large orbs.[CR]The game features two normal modes and one hidden mode. The first mode is called Cyberzone, in which players must eliminate a set number of opponents before an exit opens up and they can progress to the next level of increasing difficulties. The second mode is called Arena, in which players can choose from a variety of enemies and stages to play on, with the goal of defeating all the enemies. The final, and hardest mode, is called Cyperscape. Instead of having to eliminate a set number of enemies, Cyberscape is much more maze-focused, not having a map for players like other modes. This mode can only be unlocked by entering a code in the player select screen. All modes can be played with two players.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Debug[CR]Begin by reaching the menu where you can opt to enter Cyberspace or the Arena. Head to the Options menu and opt to change your name. Do so and change it to "CONFIG_SYS", without the quotes. Press Start and you'll reach a debug menu where you can choose any of the 75 levels to start on, your armor, Auto-Mag count, speed, lives, and rate. Press Start and you'll then start the game under the conditions chosen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Levels 71 to 75[CR]Normally, beating Level 70 will make the credits roll at the game's end, not let you progress to Level 71. However, to reach Level 71, you can go to Level 5. Ram wall left of the start fives times, then shoot the wall right of the start five times. Gather the key and use the new path to find the warp panel. This will bring you to Level 71. From there, you can progress as usual to Level 75, after which you'll go to Level 61.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Levels 71 to 75[CR]In Level 1, approach the exit and shoot it five times to reach an alternative area where you can find warps (Levels 10, 15, 20, and 25 from right to left). There, find the extra lives pod, take the lives, and then shoot the pod three times to find a key opening up an area to the west. There, you will find warps (Levels 30, 35, and 40, going counterclockwise). Head to the Level 40 warp near the dead-end and shoot then ram the wall to its right once each. Go around to the main room and use the Armor Pod. Then touch and shoot it, then take the key to open up another part of the area to the south.There, you'll find warps (Levels 40, 45, 50, and 55, going counterclockwise). Go around the corner and ram the wall to the right of the Level 55 warp once. Go around the corner to the southernmost item pod, which did not disappear if emptied. Shoot it for a key to open an area to the east.There, feel free to peruse the nearby items pods - there are warps to Levels 60 (west) and 65 (east) nearby. On the east wall, you'll notice four panels. Ram the second from the northernmost one five times, then shoot it one time. Take down the enemies that appear and you'll find a room on the other side of the revealed corridor. In its southwest corner, you'll find a warp to Level 71.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select and Nine Extra Lives[CR]When you reach the flashing wall in the first level, shoot it five times. Turn around, and you'll see a new hallway has opened up. Down it are five exits that lead to different levels, and a pod that contains nine extra lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select and Nine Extra Lives[CR]When you get to the flashing section of the wall at the end of the first level, turn 180 degrees and fire at the wall. The wall will disappear and a clue item will be there warning you that you are nearing the warp to level 10. Go forward and fire at the wall in front of you. The barrier will give way, and there will be a flashing section of the wall. Go into it and you'll warp ahead nine levels. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select and Nine Extra Lives[CR]Once you arrive at the Level 10 exit, turn around 180 degrees and fire at the wall. A new exit will appear and you can warp to Level 20 with this.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Bullet-Proof Software</studio>		<nplayers>1-4 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>3181</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585702-faceball-2000</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/faceball-2000</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/faceball-2000/3030-10852/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3181-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3181-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77596-faceball-2000-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20629-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20630-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-the-opening-demo-show-you.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20631-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-shoot-this-guy.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20632-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-there-s-an-opponent-hiding.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20633-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-shootme-enemies-are-easily.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20634-faceball-2000-game-boy-screenshot-pods-contain-power-ups-and.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2694609-faceball2000001.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/26998/2438832-faceball_2000_title.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/26998/2438829-1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5578/475699-1119112165_00.png</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3181-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Family Jockey (Japan)">		<description>Family Jockey (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="D6EF1450" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FFamily%20Jockey%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E463999D178489E050504298F4A3FFE30B48494A" size="36836" />		<title_clean>Family Jockey</title_clean>		<plot>Family Jockey is a Sports game, developed by Use and published by Namco,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>29/3/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Use</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569702-family-jockey</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/5/3/295753_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/5/3/295753_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/1/9/gfs_6892_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/8/4/gfs_6892_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/5/4/gfs_6892_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/4/gfs_6892_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/f/4/gfs_6892_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/4/4/gfs_6892_2_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/9/4/gfs_6892_2_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/2/4/gfs_6892_2_7.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Family Jockey 2 -

Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. [CR]There are four different types of levels. [CR]1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.[CR]Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.[CR]Levels that take place entirely under water.[CR]Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.[CR]Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.[CR]The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft Company</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<videoid>E_f_YS7CP_0</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18628</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585704-felix-the-cat</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/felix-the-cat</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/felix-the-cat/3030-14510/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13068</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18628-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210288-felix-the-cat-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67694-felix-the-cat-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162107-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162108-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-starting-out-with-the-boxing.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162109-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-the-second-weapon-shoots.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162110-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-driving-a-motorcycle.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162111-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-the-tank-is-the-strongest.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162112-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162113-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-flying-level.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162114-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-advancing-from-umbrella.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162115-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-to-plane.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162116-felix-the-cat-game-boy-screenshot-inside-a-pyramid.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/NvijztT.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Ferrari (Japan)">		<description>Ferrari (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="A7BDFEC8" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FFerrari%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="F9883AF35E5F49736F9DC073CE00F3779E93CF3F" size="44637" />		<title_clean>Ferrari</title_clean>		<plot>It's the ultimate driving competition... the FERRARI GRAND PRIX CHALLENGE.

The qualification race determines where the players vehicle will be placed at the beginning of the main race. The player is rewarded points which determine their standings at the end of a main race with more points being given for the higher position finished in the race. Also during a race, the player can make a pit stop to change their worn down tires and to refuel, which involves playing a minigame.

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>		<releasedate>14/1/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Malibu

It is the first game of Square's Mana series, and is a spinoff from the Final Fantasy series. This game was remade as Sword of Mana in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance.[CR]Final Fantasy Adventure is an action RPG similar in style to the original Legend of Zelda game. In this adventure, the hero - named Sumo is the Japanese version - must stop the evil Dark Lord and wizard Julius attaining immortality by touching the Tree of Mana. Several Final Fantasy themes and characters appear in this game, such as Chocobos, which are not present in the rest of the Mana series.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player plays the role of a male gladiator, forced to fight daily for the pleasure of the Dark Lord of the Glaive Empire. On his deathbed, the hero's friend Willy beseeches the hero to contact the Gemma Knight Bogard to protect Mana from the Dark Lord. With this quest, the hero proceeds to break out of the castle, only to run into the Dark Lord consulting with the mysterious wizard Julius. Julius reveals that a (player-named in the US, Fuji in Japan) girl is the key for traveling up the waterfalls to the temple of the Mana Tree. When Julius leaves, the hero is discovered by the Dark Lord, who chases the hero to a cliff and knocks the hero off a waterfall, presumably to his death.The player visiting the town of Topple.[CR]Upon recovering from his fall, the hero awakens on the outskirts of the town Topple. While adventuring, the hero will run into a fallen warrior, Hasim, being tended to by a girl. Hasim will ask the hero to take the girl to Wendel and to find Bogard. After this, Hasim passes away, and the girl decides to accompany the hero. From the townspeople of Topple, the hero learns that there is a weird old man (Bogard) who lives by the Waterfalls.[CR]With the girl in tow, the hero then goes to the old man, who reveals that he is indeed Bogard, the Gemma Knight. He reveals that he fought to protect the Mana Tree from the Vandole Empire that sought to use the power of Mana previously to take over the world. He gives the hero a Mattock, and directs him to go through the a cave to the town of Wendel to see Cibba.[CR]Passing through the swamp on the other side of the cave, the hero and the girl will arrive at Kett's House. The butler invites the hero and the girl to spend the night, but that he can't use the door behind him as it is reserved for Mr. Lee. During the night spent in the house, the girl will teach the hero the Cure spell. However, in the morning the girl will have disappeared, and the butler claims that he has not seen her. A fellow visitor at Kett's House will advise the hero that the Mystic Mirror, hidden in the Marsh cave reveals people's true colors. To gain entrance into the Marsh cave, the hero must first kill the lizardmen that protect the Bronze key.[CR]After acquiring the Bronze key, the hero can enter the Marsh Cave. Upon entering, he meets a man who tells the hero that many women have gone missing from Kett's House, and that they must be kept in the caskets in the basement of the House. The man will accompany the hero while he explores the cave, ending in a battle with a two-headed dragon in a lake. Upon defeating the Hydra, the hero receives the Mirror as well as Fire magic. The Man will then disappear.[CR]Upon returning to Kett's and showing the mirror to the butler, the butler will transform into a wolf man. After defeating the butler, the hero can enter the door that he was guarding, revealing another dungeon to traverse. At the end, the hero will find the Chain Flail, which is necessary to cross small gaps, and rescue the girl. When he returns to the entrance, he runs into Mr. Lee, who is a vampire. Upon defeating Mr. Lee, the hero will learn Sleep magic. Then the hero and the girl are free to head to Wendel.[CR]In Wendel, the hero and the girl will run into the Man who helped in the Marsh Cave. When they arrive at the Wendel Temple, the hero and the girl will finally meet Cibba. Cibba will instruct the girl to step forward onto the symbol, and suddenly the girl's mother will appear. Cibba will tell the player that the girl's mother was the one who helped Bogard and Cibba during the war with Vandole. The girl's mother will reveal to the girl that her family is the Mana Family, and they are the seeds of the Mana Tree (literally). The mother will then ask the girl to protect the Mana Tree, and to protect her pendant, which sealed the waterfalls that lead to the Mana Temple. Right then, the man from the Marsh Cave will rush in to say that Wendel is under attack, and takes the girl presumably to safety. The hero goes to follow, but finds the man to actually be Julius in disguise. Julius reveals that he only helped the hero because he wasn't sure that the girl was actually a member of he Mana family. Julius will then knock out the hero.[CR]When the hero awakes, Cibba will tell the hero that Julius took the girl west in his airship. The hero pledges to rescue her, and Cibba teaches him Heal magic. The hero will discover that he will need to cross through the Gaia cave, but the cave spits him out, and informs him that he should not walk in its mouth. Upon talking with some local dwarves, the hero disovers that the Gaia cave likes the taste of silver, so the hero heads out to find silver. He heads to an old silver Mine, where he meets the dwarf Watts, who accompanies him in the dungeon. The dungeon concludes with a battle with the Megapede, which upon defeat will yield the hero silver. Watts takes the silver and forges armor and a sword of silver, which the hero must buy to continue.[CR]Gaia will now let the hero pass, and after passing through Gaia, Bogard will appear and join the hero. Bogard will inform the hero that Julius' airship is refueling at a lake up north. Together they board the airship, and just as the airship takes off, they find the girl in a locked room. Bogard stays to guard the girl while the hero travels around to the side of the airship to rescue her through a window. The girl gives the hero her pendant, but Julius uses fire magic to knock the hero off the airship.[CR]The hero crash-lands in a house below, and is knocked unconscious. Fortunately, the hero crashes into the house of a former gladiator named Amanda, who was present at the beginning of his adventure. Unfortunately, Amanda takes the pendant and disappears. When the hero reawakens, he discovers that he is in the town of Menos. The townspeople inform him that there are Chocobos in the forest up north, and that Amanda has a brother named Lester, who plays the harp in the town of Jadd, also to the north.[CR]First the hero heads for the forest, where he finds a Chocobo egg, which hatches. The newborn Chocobo will become the new party member, allowing the hero to ride him around. With the Chocobo in tow, the hero heads to Jadd.[CR]Jadd is in bad shape, and is run by a man named Davias. Davias is the sun of Medusa, and has the ability to change people into animals. Upon questioning Davias about Amanda, he informs the hero that she is off to the Cave of Oasis, to get a tear from Medusa. The tear will break Davias' curse. By trading a bag of Fang with a boy in town, the hero learns the way into the Cave of Oasis: "Palm trees... and 8. Got it?" (the hero must walk a figure 8 around two palm trees to reveal the entrance).[CR]Once inside the cave, the hero meets up with Amanda, who tells the hero that she took the hero's pendant to give to Davias in exchange for her brother. Instead, Davias cursed her brother and turned him into a bird. Together they explore the Cave of Oasis, where the hero learns Ice magic, and find Medusa's lair. After defeating Medusa, she laughs, yielding no tears. However, during the course of the battle, Medusa bit Amanda, which curses her to turn into Medusa. As she starts the transformation, she begs the hero to take her tears and cure Lester, and kill her. The hero does, and returns to Jadd, rescuing Lester. Lester asks the hero to help him avenge his sister's death by killing Davias. Together they take out Davias, but Davias reveals that the Pendant is already en route to Glaive.[CR]To repay the hero, Lester clears out the poison gas blocking the way with his harp and teaches the hero Mute magic. With his Chocobo in tow, the hero heads north to Mt. Rocks cave, where he must battle the Metal Crab boss. After the cave, the hero must traverse Mt. Rocks, where he does battle with a Cyclops boss and the Golem boss. Upon defeating the Golem, the hero learns Lit (Lightning) magic. After that the hero finds himself where he started, outside Glaive castle.[CR]In the Glaive castle, the hero battles a Chimera. After defeating the Chimera, the hero finds the girl in a prison cell and releases her. With the girl in tow, traverses the castle to reach the top, where the Dark Lord is waiting. The hero defeats the Dark Lord alone. Meanwhile Julius hypnotizes the girl, and the hero witnesses her reversing the waterfall so that Julius can go to the Mana Temple. Julius reveals that he is the last man of the Vandole Empire, and desires the power of Mana. To stop the hero from pursuing, Julius knocks him off the waterfall, again.[CR]This time, the hero lands in a crystalline desert, where his Chocobo rescues him. Unfortunately the Chocobo is injured in the process. However, upon waking up, the player finds an injured Bogard, who was thrown from Julius' airship. The hero discovers that he is in the town of Ish, a city built near the ruins of the Vandole Empire. Bogard is gravely injured, and the hero is claimed to be the last chance for the world. The hero finds his Chocobo being treated by Dr. Bowow, who mechanizes its legs, turning it into Chocobot. With Chocobot, the hero can now traverse water. When the hero goes back to talk to Bogard, he learns that Julius already has the power of Mana, and that the only way to defeat him is with the sword Excalibur. Bogard tells the hero to go find Cibba, who knows where the sword is hidden.[CR]The hero travels back to Wendel, only to find that Cibba has left town to help with the town of Lorim, which is under attack by monsters. The hero travels to Lorim, only to find that everyone but the King in town has been frozen by the monster Kary, and Cibba is trapped in a room blocked by ice. The hero heads off to the Snowfields Cave, and takes on Kary. After defeating Kary, the hero heads back to Lorim to talk to Cibba. Cibba tells the hero that the legendary sword is hidden in the cave in the Floatrocks, and gives him the key. In the cave, the hero will fight the Kraken. After defeating the Kraken, the hero explores the Undersea Volcano, where he defeats the Iflyte for a rusty sword. Upon presenting the rusty sword to Cibba, he informs the player that they need to resurface the Dime tower, a tower from the Vandole empire, using the rusty sword.[CR]The hero goes to talk to Dr. Bowow, who reveals that Nuke magic is needed. The hero travels to the Palmy Desert Cave, where he battles the Lich for the Nuke magic. Now equipped with the Nuke magic, Dr. Bowow will reveal the location of the Cave of Ruins. Using the Nuke magic to blow the entrance open, the hero traverses the cave of ruin and fights the Mantis Ant. On a pedestal in the Cave of Ruins surrounded by waterfalls, the hero releases the power of the rusty sword, which rises the Dime tower from where it sank into the desert.[CR]Dime tower is the hero's next destination, where he meets Marcie, a robot designed by Dr. Bowow 50 years ago. With Marcie, the hero will climb Dime tower, where the hero will learn that Julius is the last hope of the Vandole Empire, and that he is the last chance to stop Julius. At the top of the tower, the hero fights Garuda, whose defeat destabilizes the tower. To escape, Marcie throws the hero to safety, sinking with the tower back into the sand.[CR]Now the hero is ready to return to Glaive castle, and take the reversed waterfall to the temple of Mana. The Mana Temple challenges the hero with three boss fights: the Dragon, the Red Dragon, and the Dragon Zombie (the zombified two-headed dragon from the Marsh cave). After defeating the Dragon Zombie, the hero will run into the girl's mother, who will congratulate the hero on becoming a great Gemma Knight and will bestow the hero with Excalibur.[CR]The hero now faces Julius, who is empowered by the Power of Mana, and reveals his plans to create a Neo-Vandole Empire. After fighting Julius three times, the hero finally grasps defeat, only to find that the Tree of Mana is dying. The girl's mother reappears, and reveals to the hero and the girl that she was the Tree, and only the girl can become the new tree. The girl is left with the decision on whether she wants to become the next Tree of Mana, and she agrees. The hero agrees to be the Tree's protector, to remain close to the girl.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game retains the top-down camera-view and active battle system of the original Legend of Zelda. The hero attacks with a variety of weapons (such as swords sickles and axes), and a strong attack is possible if the gauge at the bottom of the screen is filled by waiting between attacks. Enemies In addition, the hero can learn a predetermined set of spells (8 in all) to assist him in his journey. Occasionally, he will have a supporting character accompany him, who is not under the direct control of the player.[CR]Keeping with its RPG heritage, the hero must level up to become stronger by allocating stat points to allocated to one of four types: Wisdom (more Mana), Stamina (more Health), Power (more damage), and Will (faster bar refill).[CR]Non-playable Companions[CR]During the course of the adventure, several non-playable characters will accompany the hero temporarily. The hero can use the "Ask" command to have them perform a unique function for the hero.NameAboutAttackAskGirl[CR]The hero is on a quest to rescue her, last living descendant of the Mana Familynone[CR]heal HPMan (Julius)The hero meets him in the Swamp Cave, main antagonist of the gameMagic FireballTeaches how to use the MattockAmandaFormer Gladiator, the hero helps her in the Medusa Cave to save her brother, LesterDaggerHeals PetrifyLesterMusician, brother of Amanda, helps the hero take down DaviasArrowsChanges the background musicWattsA dwarf blacksmith in the Silver CaveAxeBuy and Sell ItemsBogardFormer Gemma KnightSwordTeaches about Max AttacksChocobo(t)The hero hatches the Chocobo.

The game was never developed because Square was approaching bankruptcy at the time.[CR]In 1991, Square officially started development on Final Fantasy Adventure under the codename "Gemma Knights." Square used its previous trademark, and released Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden in Japan. The game was written by Yoshinori Kitase, with input from Koichi Ishi, who designed all the characters for the game.[CR]The game was first re-released, along with the Final Fantasy Legend series, for the Gameboy Color by Sunsoft in 1998. Sword of Mana, a remake of Final Fantasy Adventure more in line with the Mana series, was released in 2003. A more conservative revision of Final Fantasy Adventure was released on mobile phones in Japan in 2006, with only small changes to the games graphics and sound.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dont get damaged when poisoned[CR]When you get poisoned and do not have anything to cure it, just sit still and keep repeatedly attacking, when doing this, you sustain no damage, keep doing this until you are no longer poisoned.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Square Soft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<videoid>di5Vhk3AEUc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3182</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563272-final-fantasy-adventure</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/final-fantasy-adventure</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-adventure/3030-9971/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6829</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3182-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3182-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23683-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57412-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111065-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/179529-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183280-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254329-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3182-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/3182-2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24708-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/494268-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/494269-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-european.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24709-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24710-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-a-dying-friend.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24711-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-escape.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24712-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-flight-from-the.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/24713-final-fantasy-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-welcome-to-topple.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/OPhxTVq.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Final Fantasy Legend II (USA)">		<description>Final Fantasy Legend II (USA)</description>		<rom crc="58314182" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FFinal%20Fantasy%20Legend%20II%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="6AB6890E8F688BCD87E97886A1748A4D9D341909" size="177970" />		<title_clean>Final Fantasy Legend II</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy Legend II, or SaGa II, is a follow-up to the Nintendo Gameboy's debut role-playing game. Like its sibling SaGa Gameboy games and Seiken Densetsu/Final Fantasy Adventure (also for the Gameboy), SaGa 2 bears the "Final Fantasy" moniker in North America as a result of Square trying to take advantage of the recognizable branding already in place for that franchise. In 2009, to honor of the series' 20th Anniversary, a remake of SaGa II was released for the Nintendo DS titled SaGa 2: Hihou Densetsu - Goddess of Destiny which featured polygonal cell-shaded graphics along with other enhancements.The story revolves around MAGI, the shards of a shattered statue of the goddess, Isis. The Hero is awakened by his father, who explains he has to leave for a while. He then makes his way through the Hero's open window. Years later, the Hero decides to set out to find his father, and eventually joins a fight involving new gods bent on taking over the world and the Guardians, an organization dedicated to the protection of MAGI and to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. The player visits twelve distinct worlds, in addition to the Celestial World and the shrine at its center. The goal of the game is to collect the varied pieces of MAGI scattered around each of these worlds. These MAGI pieces can also be equipped by your characters to increase stats or grant special abilities.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy Legend II, which has very similar--almost identical--gameplay to its predecessor, plays in a traditional turn-based queue style made popular by the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy series. In other words, you select a command for each of your four party members before making a final confirmation, which leads to the beginning of the "round" between player and enemy. One notable difference between Legend II's battle system and those of Dragon Quest / Final Fantasy is that each of your characters can equip multiple, distinct weapons, spells and shields -- most of which have limited uses before they break or otherwise expire. For instance, a character can carry a Rapier, Long Sword, Battle Axe and Psi Dagger, and is free to use whichever he pleases in a given round of combat. Shields similarly count as "consumable" items (i.e. use a shield for a round, and you're protected; but it'll break after multiple uses) as opposed to other armor (mail, boots, helmets), which act as one might expect (they simply buff your defense stats; they are not "used" in battle).Your human and mutant (the "mages" in this game) characters grow based on how you use them, similar to Final Fantasy II's (Famicom, Wonderswan, Playstation, Gameboy Advance) level-up system. (Note that the human level up capabilities is a change from this game's predecessor; in Final Fantasy Legend, humans needed to drink special potions in order to improve statistics.) If a character continues to attack with a Battle Axe or other strength-based weapon, eventually his strength statistics will increase. Attack with an agility-based weapon (whips, rapiers), and his agility will increase. Similarly, use of magic and magic-imbued items will increase a character's Mana. With enough work, one could conceivably craft all-around characters -- fighters and mutants who are adept at magic and fighting, respectively, past what's expected.Legend II does offer two unique playable classes: monsters and robots. Monsters don't level up; rather, they grow by eating the meat of stronger monsters left behind after battle. Eat the meat of a weaker monster, and your character will devolve accordingly. Robots level up based on the equipment you give them; in fact, weapons become infinitely rechargeable when equipped to robots (i.e. they don't break), though to balance this out, their maximum usages are cut in half. (E.g. A Long Sword starts out with 30 uses before it breaks; equip it to a robot, and it maxes out at 15, but can be "recharged" by healing at an inn.)A robot's statistics increase immediately when you equip it with weapons and armor. The statistic which is upgraded is determined in a similar fashion to how humans and mutants level up: Equip a strength-based weapon, and you'll see an immediate boost in the robot's strength statistic. Stronger equipment in general boosts a robot's maximum hit point count as well. Furthermore, armor works differently for robots. Whereas human and mutant characters can only equip one each of torso armor, footwear, gauntlets and helmets, robot characters can equip as many of whatever type of armor they want. It's entirely possible for a robot to equip four gold helmets, or two bronze helmets and two silver chest plates. The robot class offers a lot of interesting experimentation in the way of finding the best combination of weapons, items and armor that maximizes all statistics to 99, as well as hit points to 999. Caveat: Robots, no matter what you do, can never be adept magic users. Thus, equipping spellbooks and magic-imbued weaponry is a waste.Players are given a choice of how to form their party at the outset of the game. If s/he so wishes, the party can be made up entirely of robots or monsters. This bucks conventional wisdom, of course, since these parties would be too devoid of magic and too inflexible, respectively. The party of four can be accompanied by story-based "NPC's", though NPC ( non-player character) is a misnomer since you can command them in battle. These characters join and depart as dictated by the plot, and you cannot unequip anything from their person (so beware what you give them). Sometimes, the NPC's will offer powerful commands that are either likely too expensive to procure upon first meeting the character, or uncommon at that point in the game. Other times, the NPC's end up being almost useless and already obsolete upon meeting them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Years before the events of the actual game begin, the Hero is awoken by his/her father (known throughout the game simply as "Dad"), who is about to exit through a window. Dad explains that there is something for which he must leave, and to stay home and take care of Mom. Before leaving, Dad leaves behind the Prism--a piece of MAGI--for safe keeping.The game cuts to present day, and the Hero has decided that s/he will set out to look for Dad. After the Hero announces this decision at school, classmates clamor to join in on the adventure. The teacher, Mr. S, explains how the ancient gods made the world and left their mark in the physical form of pieces of MAGI--one of which happens to be the Prism that the Hero has kept all these years. Mr. S then suggests for the Hero to take along three friends to ensure a safe journey.As the Hero is about to leave town, Mr. S catches up and says that he will accompany the Hero's team for a short while. He guides the party through the first cave, past a Baby Wyrm, and takes his leave of them to guard the safety of the town. The party catches up with someone who looks like Dad from behind. Their mistake is not in vain, as the man tips the party off to a cleric named Ki who might know a thing or two about MAGI. Ki, in turn, points the party to the southern ruins. But after the party witnesses the aftermath of henchmen who've raided all MAGI under the service of a wannabe God named Ashura, Ki senses great danger and joins the party to assist in the infiltration of Ashura's base to take back the stolen MAGI.Ashura is nowhere to be found, but the party succeeds in taking back some of the MAGI stolen from the southern ruins. With the additional MAGI, passage is granted to the Celestial Plane via the Pillar of the Sky, a towering vine-like structure that serves as the central construct binding together the game's several different worlds. As the party makes its way to find Ashura in the Desert World, Ki takes her leave to protect the First World.In the Desert World, the party makes its way through a town full of hostiles to find information on how to locate Ashura's tower, which is hidden within a massive sandstorm. While inside, they come across an imprisoned man who only calls himself "Mask" and agrees to help them take down Ashura--a shared interest for which he is there in the first place. Making their way to the top, the team and Mask manage to survive Ashura and his multiple arms, reclaiming some additional pieces of MAGI. With his dying breath, however, Ashura reveals that some of his henchmen have "micronized" themselves to a microsopic size, and are now prowling inside of Ki's body to remove pieces of MAGI that actually reside inside of her.Mask leaves, and the party rushes back to Ki's temple, where her aide implores the team to go to the Giant's World to learn how to micronize and follow Ashura's men to protect Ki. Upon entering Giant's Town, however, the Hero spots Dad, but fails to convince him to come home. Dad needs to forge on ahead, he explains, to gather as much MAGI as he can. He leaves behind another MAGI to help his child and friends, and vanishes again.Once the party succeeds in obtaining an item that helps them shrink down to microsopic size, they return to Ki's temple, micronize, and enter Ki's body. After gently removing the MAGI they come across within Ki's body, the party eliminates Ashura's henchmen before they can cause her any more harm. The party exits Ki's body and returns to normal size to find Ki recovering well. Though she no longer has the healing powers she once possessed due to the MAGI within her body, she is grateful for the party's help and wishes everyone a safe journey.Moving on through the Pillar of the Sky, the party comes across the world governed by a benevolent god named Apollo. He helps the young adventurers find the MAGI in his world with cryptic hints which lead them to an underground volcano, a labyrinth illuminated blindingly by mirrors, and a large cave ruled by a being known as Dunatis. The last one of these locations lies right by a town, where a bedridden woman is distraught over her daughter, Lynn, who has ventured into Dunatis' cave to fight him. The party successfully helps Lynn defeat Dunatis, and the group takes her back home--but spot Dad talking to Lynn's mother. Overhearing her call Lynn his "daughter", the Hero makes assumptions about Dad's assumed infidelity and quietly runs off in a huff, taking the party along. The Hero then vows to continue forth with the rest of the party to collect all the MAGI on their own.Almost by accident, after moving to the next location afforded by the Pillar in the Sky, the Hero's party stumbles across the base of The Guardians, an organization sworn to protect the pieces of MAGI from those who wish to abuse their power. Thinking them the enemy, the Guardians throw the Hero and friends into a jail cell. Who should come along to clear things up but Dad, who finally reveals himself as a Guardian. However, the base comes under attack, and the party and Dad have to concentrate on evacuating the premises--leaving no time for the Hero to confront Dad about Lynn.Upon defeating the commando in charge of the siege against the Guardians, the party learns that others have kidnapped Lynn and dragged her to the world adjacent to the Guardian's World. Dad and the party rushes into the next world, but after Dad rushes towards the enemy to save Lynn, he doesn't end up emerging from the brawl. Lynn, however, is saved, and the party goes on to exact revenge for Dad's death. The team takes Lynn to her home, where her mother reveals that Dad was simply serving as a surrogate father after her real father died.Stricken with guilt, the Hero continues the adventure in honor of Dad. The party's next move takes it to a world ruled by the vain goddess Venus. Here the group learns that a couple named Flora and Nils is to be wed soon, but Flora is in love with a man named Leon. Unfortunately, Leon suffered a devastating injury that crippled him, and Venus' mandate that all "ugly" people be cast out of her city--apparently a rule including crippled citizens--prevents the two lovers from marrying. Furthermore, Venus is in no rush to help the crew find any more MAGI, and when some MAGI is indeed found in the sewers under Venus' palace, she shrugs them off as "fake."Mysteriously, a volcano rises up out of the ground in Venus' world, and after collecting all the MAGI found within, the party returns to find that Flora and Nils' wedding is about to begin. Leon crashes the party, however, and a livid Venus shows her true, oppressive colors. Feeling that justice must be served, the Hero and the party decide to stand up against Venus and engage in battle. Her defeat yields many more pieces of MAGI, which allow the party to access the next world.Emerging from the Pillar in the Sky, the party stumbles upon a world with a large and popular dragon racing circuit. As luck would have it, it's overseen by none other than Apollo, who declares that the winner of this race will be awarded with more MAGI. The party rents a dragon and eventually wins the race, despite being tripped up by vicious monsters on the race track. Taking the MAGI grand prize, the party moves on to the next world.The Pillar of the Sky's next open door grants the party access to Edo, a village tinged with a Japanese flavor. Here, the party stumbles across an opium-smuggling ring--which is referred to as a "banana" smuggling ring in the censored U.S. version of the game--headed up by a dirty merchant named Echigoya. It turns out that Echigoya is also rumored to have killed the father of Hana, one of the villagers in this world who has sworn to exact revenge by proving Echigoya's complicity in the smuggling operation. Hana goes onto one of Echigoya's ships alone, and though she is in danger, her friend Taro helps out and eventually ensures her safety--while also collecting the evidence needed to put Echigoya away for good. However, it's soon discovered that the Shogun of Edo himself is corrupt and is behind the operation. Defeating him simply leads the party to his "father", the Magnate, who sees fit to end the adventure. Of course, the Hero and friends, with Taro's aid, emerge victorious, and gather more MAGI with which to venture onto the next world.After setting things right in Edo, however, the group is greeted by a world dominated by one, incredibly long cave affectionately dubbed the "Nasty Dungeon." Here, the Hero and team encounter relentless monsters and a fairy at the end with a particularly nasty attitude if she doesn't like the answer to her question, "Wasn't that dungeon nasty?" Of course, the party perseveres and leaves to the next world.In the following world, Odin's Palace looms in the distance, and the party members finally encounter the god who has been reviving them every time they meet defeat. Understanding the importance of the party's quest, he challenges the Hero and friends in a fight to ensure that they are up to the task, willing to die to verify their strength.When the passing Odin gives the party his blessing to finish their quest, they move onto what's dubbed simply "The Final World" where Apollo surprises them by backstabbing them with a demand: Give him all of the MAGI the party has collected, or he will destroy the party's friends (whom he's happened to teleport there so that the Hero can watch them all die). The Hero complies, but after Apollo makes off with his haul, Dad surprises the group, having not perished following the attack on the Guardian's base after all. Dad reveals that there is one more hidden MAGI t, and that should he and the party be able to defeat the powerful WarMech guarding it, they can open the final door in the Pillar in the Sky to defeat Apollo and stop him from achieving true godhood.Defeating the WarMech proves no easy task, but the party and Dad prevail and confront Apollo in the Celestial Palace housed inside the Pillar in the Sky. Here, Apollo mutates into a formidable beast and begins lashing out with powerful physical and magical attacks. But after a lengthy struggle, Apollo--seemingly unable to harness his newfound godhood--begins to melt. Eventually he explodes, but not before Dad jumps in the way and takes the brunt of the blast himself, sacrificing his life.While the Hero--this time seeing Dad's lifeless body on the floor--mourns, the pieces of MAGI all unite and form the goddess Isis. Isis goes on to warn the group that the security system at the center of the Celestial World--the Arsenals--have gone haywire as a result of the events that have transpired, and that she needs everyone's help to stop it from destroying the Pillar in the Sky--the foundation of all the worlds attached to it. Joining the party, Isis leads the way down into the bowels of the Celestial world. Reaching the Arsenals, Isis leaves the party to defeat one of them on her own, leaving the Hero and the three friends to destroy the other piece of machinery. Armed with a thick armored hull, high-tech weaponry and a special incendiary weapon known as The Smasher, this beholder-esque robotic weapon proves to be the toughest enemy yet--but with perseverance the party manages to fell it and save the world from destruction.Meanwhile, Isis has wiped her hands clean, having taken care of her share of the duties handily, and declares that she must stay here at the center of the Celestial World to restore things to the way they were. There is a surprise in store for the party after Isis directs everyone to take the elevator back to the Celestial Palace; apparently restored by Isis' powers, Dad stands alive and well and accompanies the Hero and everyone else home.[CR]References to Mythology and Lore[CR]As was commonplace in Square RPG's and now in many videogames, there are several references made to Roman, Egyptian and Norse mythology and other cultural lore.CharactersIsis, a Goddess who is the living manifestation of all the pieces of magiApollo, a seemingly benevolent God who initially aids you in your questVenus, the vain Goddess of beauty who casts out the ugly and crippled from her cityAshura, an early boss and wannabe god strengthened by the power of magiOdin, a god who resurrects your party upon death and tests your ability to complete your tasktitan (male)/titania (female), a monster class blessed with great strengthchimera, a monster class based on the multi-species monster of Greek mythologymedusa, a monster class based on the Greek myth of the Gorgon Medusa, able to turn passersby into stone with a single glanceSleipnir, a monster class based on the eight-legged horse of Norse mythologymephisto, a monster class (complete with pitchfork and pointed tail) based on the Faustian demon Mephistophelescocatris, a monster class based on the mythological creature, cockatrice, which possessed a petrifying glarehydra, a monster class based on the multi-headed repitilian creature of Greek mythologyscylla, a monster class based on the sea monster of Greek mythology (represented in the game, oddly enough, by the medusa sprite)leviathn, a monster class based on the Biblical serpent LeviathanO-bake, a monster class that is essentially a ghost, based on the shape-shifting spirits of Japanese folkloreTian-lung, or tian long, translated as "divine dragon" (literally, "heaven dragon") from Chinese mythologyFenrir, the monstrous wolf from Norse MythologyLocationsValhalla, Odin&#8217;s residenceEdo, a world inspired by feudal Japan ("Edo" is the actual former name of the Japanese capital, "Tokyo")Pillar of the Sky, the central construct that holds the world together. The concept of the Pillar of the Sky bears some resemblance to the Yggdrasil, which--in Norse Mythology--is a gigantic tree (the "World Tree", as it were) and the central structure around which the nine worlds of Norse lore reside.ItemsGungnir, a deadly spear that can damage multiple enemies (so long as they are in the same group) at once, named after Odin's mythical spearXcalibr, one of the strongest swords in the game named after King Arthur&#8217;s legendary ExcaliburHermes boots, equippable boots that raises agility, named after the Greek messenger godMasmune, a piece of magi that is essentially a powerful katana named after the Japanese swordsmith MasamuneMuramas, a powerful katana named after the Japanese swordsmith MuramasaAegis, a piece of magi that covers the entire party in a protective shield for a single round, named after the Greek god Zeus' shieldPegasus, a piece of magi that can transport the party to any previously-visited locale, named after the Greek god Poseidon's winged horseArthur, body armor named after King ArthurHecate, footwear that increases magical potency, named after the Greek goddess of WitchcraftMagi, relics or stones that hold vast power and embolden those who bear them. In actuality, this is somewhat of a random and misplaced reference, as "magi" refer primarily to persons of certain ability rather than objects. Specifically, "magi" refers to those who have the ability to read and interpret the stars. In Christianity, "Magi" most commonly refers to the three Kings, or the three Wise Men.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Oddities[CR]There are a few elements scattered about the game that would likely strike a casual observer as odd or unrefined.The game sports martial arts attacks -- Punch and Kick -- which you equip like items, which seems to make little sense. Like items, they can only be used so many times before they "break" / disappear. Even stranger, the closer to "breaking" a Punch or Kick is, the more damage it does with each use. As a result, when you first equip a freshly bought Punch or Kick, attacking with it is pretty much useless. Of course, you kind of have to keep using it in order for it to yield any meaningful results.Mutants learn spells and abilities throughout the course of the game, and these take up slots in the mutants' equipment list. They can learn up to four abilities; if your wish is to have them equip more items, weapons and armor, you have to sacrifice the slots you'd use for their abilities and potentially limit them to two or three max. Further, it's possible for a mutant to learn two of the same ability. This is actually pretty neat when you learn two instances of a powerful spell (say, Flare), since that means you can use it twice as many times. The caveat, of course, is that you're out a single item slot. The stranger--and more useless--thing about this phenomenon is that you can learn two of the same inactive abilities such as a resistance to Poison. Having two equipment slots taken up just to have two instances of poison resistance, of course, is pretty pointless.Inns charge you based on how weakened you are--one gold piece per hit point needed to heal to full strength. If your four characters each only have one point of damage, a night at the inn only costs four gold. However, if they're severely damaged, the price skyrockets (the sum of each character's Maximum HP minus Current HP). You can abuse this system by having a mutant or monster use a natural healing ability to cure hit points until everyone's maxed out, and then stay at the inn to restore that healing ability. (This doesn't work with spellbooks since they are not "natural" abilities. Only natural monster and mutant abilities, as well as robot items, can be restored with a stay at the inn.)Monsters cannot equip items. However, their natural abilities--like other equippable items--have a limited number of uses. If you find yourself in a dungeon, and your monster's natural abilities have all been used up, the monster is basically a useless character who you'll have to "recharge" by trekking all the way to an inn or eating a piece of monster meat (which could potentially turn the monster into a weaker species if you're not careful).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Max AGI on a robot[CR]If you equip a weapon like punch or kick to a robot and use the last attack before the weapon breaks, after the battle you will have an empty equipment spot but you still keep the AGI.

Square-Enix announced a remake for the Nintendo DS in late August 2010 (see SaGa III).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Transformations[CR]In a slight departure from the Final Fantasy Legend and Final Fantasy Legend II, Humans and Mutants are able to evolve between monster, human and robot by consuming meat or installing components; in previous games, only meat was consumable, and only monsters could consume the meat. Typically, a human character starts out at neutral, with the robotic aspects on one side of the spectrum and the monster aspects on the other. For every piece of meat a human consumes, s/he moves one step closer to the monster side of the spectrum. For every component s/he installs, s/he moves in the opposite direction. The spectrum, with Human/Mutant form in the center, can be visualized as follows: Robot - Cyborg - Human / Mutant - Beast - Monster[CR]In addition to the transformations, Final Fantasy Legend III adds a bit more to the gameplay than was present in previous Legend games. For starters, the player's avatar is able to jump while traversing in the map screens. Also, more enemy sprites are visible on screen at once, allowing for a greater variety of enemy combinations (as opposed to in games past, where only three enemy types were allowed on-screen at once). Most significantly, the game changes how weapons are used in combat. Instead of each weapon, spell or ability having a limited amount of uses, each character can equip one weapon, possess a few "talents", and learn spells that consume Magic Points, much like more "traditional" Final Fantasies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 8,8,8 and 8 adding, "...This game has a very involving storyline to keep you interested, pretty decent tunes, and very detailed graphics [which] add up to a real winner".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Hold Down, B, and Start on the game's title screen to eventually load the Sound Test.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Barrier Fun[CR]In the X-Plane when you can fly over the ocean again, head north to the continent that's protected by an invisible barrier.

Each of the worlds is terrorized by a Fiend--a monster of great power--and the party is compelled to seek out and defeat these fiends, saving each world's denizens in the process. The final floor of the tower reveals a startling truth about the nature of the Fiends, the tower, and your party's involvement in all of the events that unfold throughout the game.[CR]Part of the SaGa series, SaGa--or Final Fantasy Legend, as it was known in North America--started some trends that repeated throughout the franchise. Instead of equipping a single weapon for attacking purposes, as was the case in the core Final Fantasy franchise, SaGa had each character equipping a "bag" of weapons and items, as described below in the Gameplay section. The series' method of character growth through taking actions and eating monster meat, as opposed to gaining experience levels, also originated here. (The "do X more and become better at Y" methodology did find its way into Final Fantasy II.) However, the multi-character, "non-linear" method of progression didn't really begin until the Super Famicom entries in the series, which were the Romancing SaGa games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy Legend plays in a traditional turn-based queue style made popular by the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy series. In other words, you select a command for each of your four party members before making a final confirmation, which leads to the beginning of the "round" between player and enemy. One notable difference between Legend's battle system and those of Dragon Quest / Final Fantasy is that each of your characters can equip multiple, distinct weapons, spells and shields -- most of which have limited uses before they break or otherwise expire. For instance, your fighter can carry a Rapier, Long Sword, Battle Axe and Psi Dagger, and is free to use whichever he pleases in a given round of combat. Shields similarly count as "consumable" items (i.e. use a shield for a round, and you're protected; but it'll break after multiple uses) as opposed to other armor (mail, helmets), which act as one might expect (they simply buff your defense stats; they are not "used" in battle).[CR]Your human characters must level up with the aid of potions, with one type of potion per main statistic. Furthermore, after you've reached a hit-point maximum of 600, further potions will only increase the maximum by one at a time. Mutant (the "mages" in this game) characters grow based on how you use them, similar to Final Fantasy II's (Famicom, Wonderswan, Playstation, Gameboy Advance) level-up system. If a mutant continues to attack with a Battle Axe or other strength-based weapon, eventually his strength statistics will increase. Attack with an agility-based weapon (whips, rapiers), and his agility will increase. Similarly, use of magic and magic-imbued items will increase a character's Mana. Oddly enough, Final Fantasy Legend never tells you when your statistics have increased naturally.[CR]Legend also offers monsters. Monsters don't level up; rather, they grow by eating the meat of stronger monsters left behind after battle. Eat the meat of a weaker monster, and your character will devolve accordingly. This monster class is one of the distinguishing factors of the Legend spin-offs, continuing in Legend II and being expanded upon in Legend III. The general logic of "eat the meat of a better monster to improve" applies, and there is a near-formulaic method of how the game determines which monster you'll end up having. However, to get one of the most powerful monsters, the Hi-Slime, you must be a certain monster and eat the meat of one of the reincarnations of one of the major bosses in the game. After that, you must have the resulting monster consume the meat of a potentially weaker, normal enemy.[CR]Players are given a choice of how to form their party at the outset of the game. If s/he so wishes, the party can be made up entirely of humans or monsters. This bucks conventional wisdom, of course, since these parties would be too devoid of magic and too inflexible, respectively.[CR]As opposed to characters whom you can revive infinitely, Final Fantasy Legend has characters who have three "lives" represented by hearts on the screen. Extra hearts could be purchased, but they were almost prohibitively expensive. Once a character dies, he loses a heart. After all hearts are lost, your only option is to go and recruit a new character from the guild--whom you'll also have to develop completely from the ground up. This mechanic was immediately removed in the sequel, where characters who were downed in battle would revive immediately afterwards with 1 hit point.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy Legend's backstory is presented in a quick text blurb at the beginning of the game:[CR]"It has been said that the tower in the center of the World is connected to Paradise. Dreaming of a life in Paradise, many have challenged the secret of the tower, but no one knows what became of them. Now, there is another who will brave the adventure..."[CR]That "another" happens to be your lead character, whom you are prompted to select before starting the game. After choosing your lead, you find him (or her) dumped in front of the town that sits at the base of the tower. This is the appropriately-named "Base Town" where your lead will recruit three party members from Base Town's guild. As you take a tour of Base Town, you come across a top-hatted gentleman who tells you that a being named Gen-Bu has hidden the key to the door in a statue in a nearby town called "Hero."[CR]Heading down to the Town of Hero, the party notices the statue mentioned earlier. However, it's missing its shield, its sword, and its armor. Apparently, in order to get the key from Gen-Bu, the party has to restore it to its proper state. The three missing pieces are being held by three kings spread across the land. As you come across the bluntly-titled King Armor, he tells you that a small-town girl from the south whom he is in love with turned down his proposal for marriage. Traveling south, your party finds out that a gang leader has threatened to destroy the girl's village if she doesn't marry him.[CR]Such aggression will not stand, man, and the party decides to help out the village and King Armor. You travel to a cave where the bandits and their leader call home, smite the filthy reject, and upon returning to King Armor, he happily rewards your heroes with the first piece of the statue: a suit of armor.[CR]After the party travels to King Sword's domain to obtain the next piece for the statue, you discover that this king isn't quite so ready to give up his prized possession just yet. You must defeat him, he says, if you want the sword. The party takes him down with only minimal difficulty. Two down, and one left to go. Off to King Shield, then.[CR]King Shield's castle is full of hostile guards who, unwilling to even battle, take it upon themselves to throw the party out of the building as soon as they try to engage in any conversation. Finally reaching the King, you find that he's unwilling to give you his shield...because he's as dead as a doorknob. His Steward, whom you've caught red-handed, sends his minions after your party as he makes his way through a hidden passageway. Dispatching his thugs, you catch up to, corner, and ultimately defeat him.[CR]In possession of the three statue items, you return to the Town of Hero and replace the armor, shield and sword. Miraculously, your party is bequeathed the key--a black sphere--that is said to open the door to the tower at Base Town. But as you head back to make use of your new toy, Gen-Bu appears and engages you in battle. The party must withstand this giant turtle's powerful attacks, and it does so, with much difficulty. That arduous task being over with, the party heads back to Base Town to unlock that door.[CR]Inside the tower, the party sees a sprawling structure of many flights whose doors open up to different worlds. The first new world is dominated by a vast sea, and features a town with beautiful ports where your party figures that it'll need a boat to get around. Obviously. One of the townsfolk spits some seemingly absurd pointers your way: "I saw an island sailing like a ship." But hey, when you need a ship, you need a ship. The party ventures to an underwater cave and, sure enough, locates a small piece of floating land that seems to bend to the lead character's will, giving you the perfect "ship"--your very own piece of real estate--with which to sail the seas.[CR]During your time in town, you learn that you'll need a blue and red orb to pass through to the next level of the tower. The Red Orb is hidden underwater, and after receiving a tip from a nutso old man living in solutide, the party sets off to obtain the Airseed--a magical item that allows its bearer to breathe underwater. Once the party obtains the Airseed and ventures to an underwater town, the heroes learn that they must head to a nearby underwater castle to find the Red Orb. Their journey takes them to a room filled with orbs, and after sifting through them and finally finding the right one, the fearsome Sei-Ryu--a slithery dragon--attacks them. Though this is a more difficult battle than the one against Gen Bu, the party prevails and walks off with the Red Orb.[CR]And what of the Blue Orb? The party travels back to the old man on his island, at which point he asks them a riddle--to give him an item that costs the same as the total cost of a list of other items. After completing the arduous task of finding the items in question, doing some basic math, and buying an item that satisfies the riddle, the party is rewarded with the Blue Orb... which merges with the Red orb to form yet another Sphere which unlocks the next door in the tower.[CR]The party emerges, after a grueling trek up more tower floors, in a world floating in the clouds. Wandering into a nearby town called "Sky Town" for obvious reasons, you learn of Byak-Ko, the near-tyrannical leader of this world, and of the secret resistance plotting against him. Somehow, your heroes find their way into his employ and are sent by him to find Jeanne, whose background he doesn't divulge. He sends you off in a huff, providing you with a sky glider with which to travel between areas.[CR]Touring around a town, you find out why he wants Jeanne. It turns out that when she and her twin sister are united, the next sphere--and your ticket farther up the tower--will reveal itself. The party finds Jeanne being taken alive by some of Byak-Ko's other men. Honorable and just as your party members are, they rush in to defeat the grunts and save Jeanne. She begs you to save her twin sister Mileille, who's trapped in a floating palace.[CR]The party makes its way to the floating palace and fights its way to Mileille, who is standing helpless in a corner. She asks where her sister is, but after you divulge that information, Byak-Ko suddenly appears. "I knew you defeated Gen Bu and Sei-Ryu," he says. "I just used you." Now that he knows Jeanne's location, with the help of a treacherous Mileille who served as bait (she doesn't care anything about the resistance, and was apparently tempted by Byak-Ko's promises of power), he throws your heroes in jail.[CR]Bars can't hold your heroes, however, and they find their way back to the floating palace, where Byak-Ko is standing over both Mileille and Jeanne. He now has the sphere, or so he thinks, and as such he finds that he doesn't need Mileille anymore. As he's about to strike Mileille down, however, Jeanne takes the blow--despite her sister's previous traitorous ways--and suffers a mortal wound. A tiring battle between your heroes and Byak-Ko ensues. Byak-Ko is surprised at his failure, and as he dies, the sphere disappears as well. As the party wonders what's going on, Mileille begins to cry as her sister's life flickers away, with her tears forming the real sphere. It is time, it seems, to move on.[CR]The party fights its way through another few floors of the tower, but instead of being greeted by the ocean or the clouds, your heroes inhale the stinky wiff of a dingy, mundane dystopia. While wandering around, they are randomly assaulted--multiple times--by a fearsome (and apparently persistent) beast known as SuZaku. Attempts to battle SuZaku are all futile, and every encounter ends in the party fleeing to fight another day. Along your travels, you randomly bump into the top-hatted gentleman from Base Town (or perhaps an evil twin), who verifies that nothing works against SuZaku, and that running is the right and only move at this point.[CR]Your heroes also spot a damsel in distress, Sayaka, who--upon being rescued--leads you to a town. Once there, they hit--where else?--the pub and immediately get into an argument, but fortunately, it's with Sayaka's brother So-Cho, who stands down when he realizes you helped her. It comes to pass that there's a biker gang in town, and they're all gunning for SuZaku's head. Perhaps an alliance would best serve everybody.[CR]But in order to take down SuZaku, they have to take down his force field--which, currently, is an impossibility. The biker gang is working on building a machine--affectionately known as ERASE99--to help out in this regard, though, so the party agrees to retrieve parts scattered across this world to facilitate this task. By the time your party is ready to find the last component--some Plutonium--the heroes encounter a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: radioactive barriers blocking a doorway. So-Cho comes to the rescue, barreling his way through the barriers, but at the cost of his life.[CR]After the heroes mourn So-Cho's death (by calling him a fool for being so rash, natch), they take the Plutonium but are assaulted by a War Machine. A tough battle ensues, and when the party emerges victorious, your heroes find themselves back in town where SuZaku has absolutely decimated everything in sight. The party makes its way to the Skyscraper, climbing it in search of SuZaku so that vengeance can be exacted posthaste. After a difficult trek through the Skyscraper and through some subway cars, you come upon SuZaku who--with the aid of Sayaka--is now trapped. The party activates ERASE99, SuZaku's force field is brought down, and a real battle now begins.[CR]With his force field neutralized, SuZaku is vulnerable but still difficult to defeat. Eventually the party takes him down, and goes with Sayaka to mourn So-Cho at his freshly planted grave. By chance, Sayaka happens to have "something" and gives it to your heroes- it's the fourth and final sphere, allowing you access to the last areas of the tower and the ultimate enemy, the Arch-Fiend Ashura.[CR]On your party's travels up the tower, the heroes come across a few tower-dwellers who seem to be living peacefully. Ashura has made them rich, one says. Another claims that Ashura has made some fellow called "Creator" absolutely powerless. Further up the tower, the party encounters a series of messages stating that Ashura is being controlled by something, with the last piece of the message is illegible. The party will soon find out when it reaches the top and finally faces off against Ashura, the Arch-Fiend to end all Arch-Fiends.[CR]Near the summit, the top-hatted gentleman appears again, and warns the group that Ashura is just beyond the passage behind him. When your heroes finally confront him, he attempts to "make a deal" with them: "I'll give each of you a piece of the world. How does that sound?" Not keen on being turned into Ashura's own personal fiends, of course, the group dismisses this "offer" and engages in battle with the Arch-Fiend. Ashura, sporting four arms, sharp talons, a fanged and menacing face in his abdomen and horns sprouting from his head, turns out to be no simpleton, assaulting the team with curse spells and a vicious melee attack that strikes six times. Nevertheless the heroes prevail, as they always do, and push past Ashura's corpse into Paradise.[CR]Or so they think. Instead, they are greeted with a trap door that sends the four heroes tumbling down to the base of the tower, back in Base Town. However, it's not all bad news: The friends they've made along the way are standing there, imparting words of thanks and encouragement. As the party wanders around, the top-hatted gentleman appears again, standing in front of a door near the Innkeeper. "There is a road to Paradise," he tempts, "beyond the door."[CR]The road happens to be another trek up the same tower you just fell from all the way to the top. Again. As your heroes venture up again, Gen Bu, Sei-Ryu, Byak-Ko and SuZaku rear their ugly heads again as undead fiends, making the journey even more difficult. Fortunately, with the help of new weapons such as the Sun Sword, they fall easily to your heroes.[CR]More climbing and the party finally stumbles into what's supposed to be Paradise. A little exploration, and your heroes run into the top-hatted gentleman one last time. He reveals himself to be The Creator. The Creator claims to have created everything to see true courage. This much may have been true, but to your heroes, apparently it served much more to amuse him than to actually feel the fulfilment that seeing unbridled heroism would bring.[CR]The Creator and the heroes face off in a final battle, but in the end, the party wins, essentially "destroying God". They take a few steps forward and notice one last door. "Is there another world?" asks one hero. Perhaps, but they all decide that in the end, it's best to just go home--which they do, with much aplomb.[CR]End credits.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Oddities[CR]Final Fantasy Legend's player experience is sometimes hampered by odd usability issues and oversights.The game doesn't tell you when your mutant's stats increase after battle. You'll have to continually check your mutants' status screen to see what their ratings are.The game doesn't tell you when your mutants gain or drop abilities. You'll have to keep checking your mutant's ability menu to see if you've gained or dropped abilities. Furthermore it also drops abilities at random, unlike in its sequel where the last ability listed in your mutant's abilities menu is always the one that's dropped.The ability menu doesn't let you sort your characters' abilities. With Humans, this is a non-issue because you can sort their commands using the laborious method of equipping and unequipping things until you have the desired menu order, but for mutants, it can lead to ugly menus with blank spots.During battle, players cannot take a pass in a round to defend or just sit idle. This means that you have to use an item or weapon, even if it happens to only have a single use left. This problem also exists in Final Fantasy Legend II.Human stats can level up to values higher than 99, but the game only displays 99. Furthermore, if you continue to level-up human stats past 255, the stat will actually loop around and lower itself to 1.The game is incredibly unbalanced with progression. Humans gain hit points, strength and agility through power-up items. STRONG and AGILITY potions cost 300 gp throughout the entire game, so it's possible to maximize your stats pretty early in the game with no scaling increase in effort. Furthermore, Mutants can increase their Mana statistic easily by using the ESP ability during battle. The sole purpose of this ability is to increase the chances that the caster's Mana will increase after a battle, so it's entirely possible to hit 99 Mana in the first half of the game.[CR]Selected cross-series / sequel trivia[CR]As you ascend the tower near the end of the game, the music that plays is very similar to the music used later in the Tower of Bab-il (Babel) from Final Fantasy IV (SNES, Playstation, GBA, NDS).Lich, Tiamat and Kraken appear as enemies in this game. In the original Final Fantasy and its remakes (NES, Playstation, GBA, PSP), these three were the elemental fiends of Earth, Wind and Water respectively.Major boss-level enemies in Legend re-appear in Legend II as regular, albeit powerful, enemies: Gen-Bu; Byak-Ko; Sei-Ryu; Su-Zaku.The visual representation of Ashura in Final Fantasy Legend use a sprite that is almost identical (if not entirely so) to the one seen in Final Fantasy Legend II. However, in the sequel, Ashura is one of the earliest boss characters you face in the game.The concept of the four fiends is a theme that appears in other Final Fantasy games, notably the original Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IV. The four spheres relinquished by the fiends is analogous to the four crystals which the Final Fantasy series at large is known for.The cover art and logo for Final Fantasy Legend are different than most others in the series before the Playstation Era. The font used for the game's marquee is not the embossed gold lettering, but a flat curvy font. In addition, the cover art is a helmet, sword, and treasure chest under a ray of light. For the American covers of Final Fantasy Legend II, Final Fantasy Legend III, The Final Fantasy Adventure, and Final Fantasy IV (at least as it appeared in North America on the Super NES in 1991), the words "Final Fantasy" all used the same gold, embossed font sitting atop a single solid color (blue, purple, green and red, respectively). Furthermore, the sword replacing the letter "T" in "Fantasy" is missing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Creator kill[CR]The last boss of the game has a weakness you can exploit!!  In the fourth world, you can buy a weapon called SAW.  Normally, this weapon is not effective against any enemy but against the Creator, it will work!

The game is a top-down shooter, similar to the more action oriented portions of the original Metal Gear. Fortified Zone later had a Japan only sequel for the Game Boy, titled Ikari no Yousai 2, and a Super Nintendo Entertainment System sequel titled Operation Logic Bomb.  The game stars two elite commandos: Masoto Kanzaki (the male commando) and Mizuki Makimura (the female commando). Their goal is to infiltrate a jungle base. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Players can switch between the two characters at any time.     There is a lot about Fortified Zone that can be considered unique for its time, particularly the ability to switch between the two playable characters at any time during the game. Masoto and Mizuki have separate abilities that must be utilized in order to gather special items, reach secrets, and pass crucial parts of the game. Masoto is able to use special weapons, such as hand grenades and a flamethrower, while Mizuki can jump.  At four stages in length (titled, in order, Field, Jungle, Caves, and Complex), Fortified Zone is a relatively short game. The goal in each stage is to reach the boss, by reaching a particular set of stairs leading to the respective boss room. The boss is in an isolated room each time, and upon defeating him the player moves onto the next level.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>26/2/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Jaleco USA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.3</rating>		<videoid>7hjGvVCr1fU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18630</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585718-fortified-zone</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/fortified-zone</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/fortified-zone/3030-18616/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13503</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18630-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253305-fortified-zone-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253306-fortified-zone-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103533-fortified-zone-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60591-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60592-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-intro-clip.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60593-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-choosing-hero-heroine.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60594-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-first-room.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60595-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-practicing.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60596-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-first-blood.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60597-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-kill-kill-kill.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60598-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-girl-in-action.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60599-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-it-s-a-rocket-launcher-run.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/708651-fortified-zone-game-boy-screenshot-map.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Nkv8Mi7.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball (USA, Europe)">		<description>Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="9A494AE6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FFrank%20Thomas%20Big%20Hurt%20Baseball%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="CCEA5B85ED334A2BF7BD4449F07BBF3A86841DFD" size="204682" />		<title_clean>Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball</title_clean>		<plot>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences.

The player controls frogs home, while avoiding obstacles. The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  [CR]The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.[CR]First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.[CR]A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.[CR]Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.[CR]Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.[CR]Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Start a game, and purposely get a game over.

One of their attacks - which won't occur if too few (2~5) enemies are left - is to use a tractor beam to get your ship. This initially causes a loss of life, implying this is bad. Actually, this is good - if you shoot down the Galaga that took your ship while it is diving for another attack, then you will be able to recapture that ship and fire two missiles at once, and take two hits before another loss of life. (If you shoot the ship, it gives you a bonus 1,000 points instead. You can shoot the ship at any time. Just note that if you hit the Galaga while it's not actively moving, then the ship will attack you!)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]On most revisions of Galaga, there's a trick that stops enemies from firing at your ship.  In Stage 1, kill all aliens except the two bees in the bottom-left corner.  Allow the bees to dive down and shoot at you, while dodging their shots.  After around 15 minutes or so, the bees will continue to drop down, but they won't fire.  Let them drop down another 5 or 6 times, then kill them.  After all this, enemies will not shoot at you for the rest of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Wait until one of the top ships(the green ones that take two shots to kill) comes down and fires off a tractor beam(the beam that can capture your ship).  Let it capture your ship.  Now, wait until it swoops down again with your ship behind it.  Simply kill the head ship(the green one), and it will lose your ship.  Your ship will then lock on to the side of your current ship, giving you two ships to play with at the same time!  Now, be careful.  Not only will both ships be firing at you after your ship gets captured, but if you accidently shoot your captured ship, you'll destroy it.  Also note, this will cost you one life, but will definately make the Challenging Stages, and perhaps the game itself, a little easier to play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR][B]Note[/B]:  This works in [B]all[/B] non-bootleg/hack versions of [I]Galaga[/I], as well as most of the sequels and Arranged Mode in [I]Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1[/I].</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Compilation, Arcade</genre>		<studio>Namco</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>9.0</rating>		<videoid>56-3BWCIHNA</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18633</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585721-arcade-classic-no-3-galaga-galaxian</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18633-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/4/3/46243_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/9/5/gfs_46675_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/4/5/gfs_46675_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/f/5/gfs_46675_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/e/5/gfs_46675_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/5/5/gfs_46675_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/5/gfs_46675_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/4/a/gfs_1966_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/9/a/gfs_1966_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/0/8/gfs_46675_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/d/8/gfs_46675_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18633.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Game &amp; Watch Gallery (USA) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Game &amp; Watch Gallery (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="99B2FE79" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGame%20%26%20Watch%20Gallery%20%28USA%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="F8C5AD6D6BF1A5A90DFFEBADA1DBD69A93720C83" size="177832" />		<title_clean>Game &amp; Watch Gallery</title_clean>		<plot>The Game &amp; Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first portable compilation featuring their popular line of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and friends.[CR]The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and "Modern" version of each game:[CR]1.

One of the major issues with the original Game Boy Wars is that the computer AI requires a very long think time before making a move for each unit. As the name of this game suggests the main focus of this entry in the series is to improve on the speed of the game, specifically the thinking time of the computer AI over the original Game Boy Wars. Hudson has been able to implement a stronger and smarter computer AI while also increase the speed to roughly five times over its predecessor.[CR]The game contains a total of 54 all new maps created specifically for this iteration of the series. A different version that is only available via the Famitsu gift exchange program was also made available at the time. This version contained completely original maps which could not be found in the original version.[CR]Other than differences described above, the game itself is entirely based on the original Game Boy Wars game. All units available in the game are the same, and so is the basic system of the game. Like the original Game Boy Wars the game also features a full save system which allow users to store up to two game saves (between battles) and one quick save (in battle).[CR]The game's package is different to other traditional Game Boy games where the case is made of metal. The game retailed for 4200yen (before tax) and was published by Hudson on June 27th, 1997 as a Japanese only release.[CR][B]References:[/B][CR]Official website (Japanese)[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>27/6/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Strategy, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Hudson</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>19079</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569999-game-boy-wars-turbo</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-wars-turbo/3030-22264/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19079-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/4/3/306443_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/5/f/gfs_9010_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/8/f/gfs_9010_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/c/2/gfs_9010_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/2/gfs_9010_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Game Boy Wars Turbo - Famitsu Version (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Game Boy Wars Turbo - Famitsu Version (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="86D04BFB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGame%20Boy%20Wars%20Turbo%20-%20Famitsu%20Version%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="A0106F20AAF857A7BA033537821E31C6EC074DD6" size="132388" />		<title_clean>Game Boy Wars Turbo - Famitsu Version</title_clean>		<plot>Game Boy Wars is a Strategy game, developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>21/5/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Strategy, Turn-Based, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Intelligent Systems</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>19079</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569697-game-boy-wars</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/game-boy-wars</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-wars/3030-21674/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2619120-0466498081-Game_.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/2/7/306227_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429542-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-opening-animation.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429543-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429544-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429545-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-after-choosing-one-or-two.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429546-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-select-a-map.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429547-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-a-look-at-the-map-up-close.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429548-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-these-are-the-starting-stats.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429549-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-cry-havoc-and-let-slip-the.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429550-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-player-1-starts.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429551-game-boy-wars-game-boy-screenshot-here-is-your-starting-point.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Game de Hakken!!

You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Accolade</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>18632</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585739-the-game-of-harmony</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/game-of-harmony</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-game-of-harmony/3030-4630/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18632-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224459-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172928-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172929-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-level.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172930-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-screenshot-all-you-need-do-is.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172931-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-screenshot-make-sure-the-same.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/172932-the-game-of-harmony-game-boy-screenshot-the-puzzles-get-more.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2860/479548-1181446120_00.png</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2860/479547-1181446108_00.png</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2860/479542-1181446130_00.png</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2860/479479-1181446088_00.png</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2860/479478-1181446075_00.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Gamera - Daikaijuu Kuuchuu Kessen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Gamera - Daikaijuu Kuuchuu Kessen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="62769EC1" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGamera%20-%20Daikaijuu%20Kuuchuu%20Kessen%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="C6EC7AA3AD2B28CA43551CDA3C0CFDBCB4377B45" size="141998" />		<title_clean>Gamera - Daikaijuu Kuuchuu Kessen</title_clean>		<plot>Gamera: Daikaijuu Kuuchuu Kessen is an Action game, developed by Kid and published by Angel (Bandai),which was released in Japan in 1995.</plot>		<releasedate>3/3/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>Kid</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569920-gamera-daikaijuu-kuuchuu-kessen</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/0/306380_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/0/306380_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/6/d/gfs_9605_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/d/gfs_9605_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/f/0/gfs_9605_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/2/0/gfs_9605_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Ganbare Goemon - Kurofunetou no Nazo (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Ganbare Goemon - Kurofunetou no Nazo (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="910AFE24" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGanbare%20Goemon%20-%20Kurofunetou%20no%20Nazo%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="BD336346982E33270128B74A7B356E9E6824E4A6" size="117962" />		<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon - Kurofunetou no Nazo</title_clean>		<plot>A giant UFO has appeared over Oedo Castle, and the Mystical Ninja is off to save the world again!

The Ghouls tell legends of the Red Blaze, a mythical gargoyle that will save them from destruction.[CR]The gameplay takes place in one of two perspectives: a top down overworld where the player moves Firebrand from town to town, exploring the Ghoul Realm in search of power-ups and dungeons. When the player enters a dungeon, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling platformer with a heavy emphasis on vertical traversal, as Firebrand has wings offering limited hovering flight, as well as the ability to cling to walls to ascend even further.[CR]While the game doesn't have a traditional XP system and character-levels, as the story progresses, Firebrand learns new abilities and spells, offering greater traversal before eventually allowing infinite flying ability and devastating ranged attacks, effectively turning Firebrand into the Red Blaze of legend. Being "given your wings" near the end of the game is one of the game's more liberating and memorable moments.[CR]The overworld map features frequent random battles, where the player is thrown into a small "arena" dungeon where Firebrand must defeat a group of enemies before he is rewarded with power-ups and allowed to continue. Some of these battles are not altogether random, as some enemy characters can be seen in the overworld map and engaged at the player's discretion.[CR]This combination of traditional RPG tropes and challenging action gameplay featuring very large sprites and screen-filling boss encounters makes Gargoyle's Quest one of the most original titles of its time, and still quite unique to this day.[CR]The game uses a password system in lieu of a battery pack for saving the game.[CR]There are two sequels to this game, Gargoyle's Quest 2 on NES and Demon's Crest on SNES.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Capcom U.S.A.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.9</rating>		<videoid>cxU3EnDZnJo</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13069</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585723-gargoyles-quest</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/gargoyles-quest</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/gargoyles-quest/3030-13688/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9413</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13069-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253281-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253243-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/259811-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280309-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-kings-of-the-ghoul.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280519-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-level-kill.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280310-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-you-often-need-to-complete.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280311-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-firebrand-s-abilities.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280312-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-second-boss-fight.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280313-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-talking-to-a-helpful.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280314-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-random-battle.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280315-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-world-map-about.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280316-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-use-the-block-buster.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/280317-gargoyle-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-another-boss-fight.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/7c8To95.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Gauntlet II (USA, Europe)">		<description>Gauntlet II (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="1907DAC5" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGauntlet%20II%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="DC37DF322B54A5DF5D04BC637E26B011B84598BF" size="138518" />		<title_clean>Gauntlet II</title_clean>		<plot>The arcade megahit comes to the NES!

simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.[CR]Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.[CR]By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.[CR]All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Acclaim

He captures Diana's baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters: Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum.[CR]Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters' accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Activision</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>WjYqE7QhiRc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>10745</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585729-ghostbusters-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/ghostbusters-ii_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ghostbusters-ii/3030-7445/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9081</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2361756-nes_ghostbusters2.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207034-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207035-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/274993-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/80601-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/80602-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-roughly-follows.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635769-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-ghostbusters.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/80603-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-selecting-two-ghostbusters.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/80604-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-winston-fires-his-proton.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635773-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-life-lost.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635772-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-floor-2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635774-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-catch-him.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635775-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-what-is-that.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/635777-ghostbusters-ii-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Sy2Il7j.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="GI King! - Sanbiki no Yosouya (Japan)">		<description>GI King! - Sanbiki no Yosouya (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="150BC291" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGI%20King%21%20-%20Sanbiki%20no%20Yosouya%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="DE6109B643A97E7A96E55A6BECFD7E61DFDC915E" size="38933" />		<title_clean>GI King! - Sanbiki no Yosouya</title_clean>	</game>	<game name="Ginga (Japan) (En,Ja)">		<description>Ginga (Japan) (En,Ja)</description>		<rom crc="87D0637B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGinga%20%28Japan%29%20%28En%2CJa%29.zip" sha1="14F4F14CAEE081DCEADB9D31AE26FD8968C432EA" size="34415" />		<title_clean>Ginga</title_clean>		<plot>Ginga is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hot-B,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Hot-B</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/579898-ginga</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/7/0/316970_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/e/c/gfs_20682_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/3/c/gfs_20682_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/7/1/gfs_20682_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/a/1/gfs_20682_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Gluecksrad (Germany)">		<description>Gluecksrad (Germany)</description>		<rom crc="E8B26577" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGluecksrad%20%28Germany%29.zip" sha1="638CD5087B53B7FE7C6ECE99FD973F98C0C09EBE" size="41032" />		<title_clean>Gluecksrad</title_clean>		<plot>Bring Vanna White, fun puzzles, and the glittering sets of Wheel of Fortune into your home.Spin for fantastic prizes, solve the puzzles, and hear the studio audience go wild.Tackle 3,000 puzzles and beat the clock in exciting bonus rounds.Play against up to two other players, and then take a sample contestant exam for the actual show.See for yourself what it's like to be a contestant on Wheel of Fortune.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited time[CR]Use the following actions to bypass the timer during game play and allow easier puzzle solving.

You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over.[CR]There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic your actions.[CR]The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]On the title screen, input the following codes.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Electro Brain Corp.,Toei Animation</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>v3YdQIG2Fh4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21644</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585730-go-go-tank</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/go-go-tank</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/go-go-tank/3030-34659/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21644-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131646-go-go-tank-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131647-go-go-tank-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348043-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-north-american-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348038-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-japanese-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348041-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-end-of-level-score-calculation.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348045-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-go-go-tank.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348046-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-the-map-race-to-the-hill.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348047-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-carrying-a-block.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348048-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-the-tank-can-now-get-over-this.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348049-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348050-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-avoiding-projectiles.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348051-go-go-tank-game-boy-screenshot-level-clear.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Goal!

He appeared in Son of Godzilla (1967) and Godzilla's Revenge (1969). He appeared again here, in video game form. Horrible monsters have kidnapped Minilla and hidden him somewhere among the sixty-four rooms of a giant labyrinth. Godzilla must traverse the levels while avoiding enemies from various Godzilla movies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]By pausing the game, players are given four options: Continue, Try Again, Entire Plan, and Password. Try again restarts the level from the beginning with all objects in their original places. Entire Plan shows a map of all sixty-four rooms: unvisited rooms were marked with a question mark, while visited rooms were marked with arrows representing passages to other rooms. The room in which one currently stood blinks. Password shows the password for the current level. Two passwords were displayed: a four-digit password which started the player in the room they left off in but without any other rooms cleared and an eighteen digit password which started players in the room they left off in while also keeping all previously cleared rooms still in a state of completion.[CR]Somewhere, in one of these rooms, Minilla is trapped. To complete the game, the player must find that room. In each room, there are multiple doors which lead to different rooms. Marked by an arrow, these doors only appear when all boulders in the room are smashed. By pressing the B button, Godzilla throws a punch. Unless the boulder is pressed up against either a wall or another boulder, the rock will only move in the direction it was hit. Most monsters can be defeated with a simple punch (a press of the B button), though they eventually re-spawn. Some enemies present particular challenges due to their special abilities: Rodan could fly and Hedorah could only be defeated with rocks (either by a boulder being dropped on top of him or by being smashed between a wall and a boulder) though he could be pushed back with a fist. Also, if the puzzle wasn't solved fast enough, an invincible enemy, Ghidorah, appears.[CR]There are three UI elements while playing: the stage number, the player's score and the player's health bar. The stage number shows which one of the sixty-four rooms the player is currently in. The player's score increases every time a boulder or enemy is destroyed, and from the amount of health Godzilla has left when the stage is completed. Godzilla's health bar shows how close he is to dying; he will lose health upon touching an enemy.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]BaragonMovie Appearance: Frankenstein vs. Baragon (1965)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).MechagodzillaMovie Appearance: Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).HedorahMovie Appearance: Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971)Method of Defeat: Boulder Smash (a boulder falling on top of him or being hit by a boulder when standing next to a wall).AnguillasMovie Appearance: Godzilla Raids Again (1955)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).RodanMovie Appearance: Rodan (1956)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button), especially good at evasion due to its ability to fly.GhidrahMovie Appearance: Ghidorah, The Three Headed Monster (1964)Method of Defeat: Invincible, appears after set amount of time and kills Godzilla immediately.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Password 18 Listings[CR]At the title screen, opt to "Continue", then select "Password 18".

Horrible monsters have kidnapped Minilla and hidden him somewhere among the sixty-four rooms of a giant labyrinth. Godzilla must traverse the levels while avoiding enemies from various Godzilla movies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]By pausing the game, players are given four options: Continue, Try Again, Entire Plan, and Password. Try again restarts the level from the beginning with all objects in their original places. Entire Plan shows a map of all sixty-four rooms: unvisited rooms were marked with a question mark, while visited rooms were marked with arrows representing passages to other rooms. The room in which one currently stood blinks. Password shows the password for the current level. Two passwords were displayed: a four-digit password which started the player in the room they left off in but without any other rooms cleared and an eighteen digit password which started players in the room they left off in while also keeping all previously cleared rooms still in a state of completion.[CR]Somewhere, in one of these rooms, Minilla is trapped. To complete the game, the player must find that room. In each room, there are multiple doors which lead to different rooms. Marked by an arrow, these doors only appear when all boulders in the room are smashed. By pressing the B button, Godzilla throws a punch. Unless the boulder is pressed up against either a wall or another boulder, the rock will only move in the direction it was hit. Most monsters can be defeated with a simple punch (a press of the B button), though they eventually re-spawn. Some enemies present particular challenges due to their special abilities: Rodan could fly and Hedorah could only be defeated with rocks (either by a boulder being dropped on top of him or by being smashed between a wall and a boulder) though he could be pushed back with a fist. Also, if the puzzle wasn't solved fast enough, an invincible enemy, Ghidorah, appears.[CR]There are three UI elements while playing: the stage number, the player's score and the player's health bar. The stage number shows which one of the sixty-four rooms the player is currently in. The player's score increases every time a boulder or enemy is destroyed, and from the amount of health Godzilla has left when the stage is completed. Godzilla's health bar shows how close he is to dying; he will lose health upon touching an enemy.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]BaragonMovie Appearance: Frankenstein vs. Baragon (1965)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).MechagodzillaMovie Appearance: Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).HedorahMovie Appearance: Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971)Method of Defeat: Boulder Smash (a boulder falling on top of him or being hit by a boulder when standing next to a wall).AnguillasMovie Appearance: Godzilla Raids Again (1955)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button).RodanMovie Appearance: Rodan (1956)Method of Defeat: Godzilla's Fist Punch (B button), especially good at evasion due to its ability to fly.GhidrahMovie Appearance: Ghidorah, The Three Headed Monster (1964)Method of Defeat: Invincible, appears after set amount of time and kills Godzilla immediately.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<rating>1.8</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>18684</thegamesdb_id>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18684-1.jpg</boxart1>	</game>	<game name="Golf (World)">		<description>Golf (World)</description>		<rom crc="6ED10383" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGolf%20%28World%29.zip" sha1="2ACEE1A14BA611E73B0B7D6BCE170107213FCC0C" size="68781" />		<title_clean>Golf</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golf was originally released for the Japanese Famicom in 1984, and was the third of Nintendo's mononym first-party sports games for the system after Baseball and Tennis. It was later released in the US in 1985, Europe in 1986 and for the Famicom Disk System in Japan in 1986. It later saw adaptations for the Game Boy and Sharp X1, and was rereleased for e-Reader and on the 3DS eShop. Nintendo's Golf is also present in NES Remix.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game offers single-player stroke play, two-player stroke play, and two-player match play. The player can select a club and initiate a swing. The swing shows a gauge at the bottom of the screen which has to be charged up for the desired power and then subsequently stopped in a narrow area otherwise the ball will curve to the left or the right. Wind direction also affects the flight of the ball.[CR]Putting shows the slope of the green and allows the player to aim with an arrow to compensate for slope. Putting strokes are performed similar to other strokes but only the putter is allowed once on the green. The game does not simulate different cuts of grass or rough: a ball is either on the fairway, in a bunker, on the green, out of bounds, or in the water. If a ball lands out of bounds or in the water the player has to retry the stroke and also takes a penalty stroke. All game modes are played on a single course.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Re-Do a Shot[CR]Didn't like a shot? Quickly, BEFORE the ball stops rolling, press A+B+Select+Start to go back to Main Menu. Continue from your file and the game will take you to the place where you had the previous shot, but not after. Shoot again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Training Mode[CR]At the Main Menu, press DOWN + START to reach Training mode. Now you can play your hole of choice as many times as you want.</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<ESRB>E -

[CR]The game retains the signature Gradius power-up system. This system allows players to save power-ups to unlock more powerful powers instead of having the power-up applied instantly when picked up.

In most of the game's stages, the player, as Gizmo, must explore the area and reach the goal while defeating enemies, avoiding traps such as spiked floors, and jumping over gaps. The remaining stages consist solely of boss fights in which Gizmo must do battle with a gremlin. As the player progresses through the game, Gizmo will acquire more and more powerful weapons, starting with simple tomatoes and eventually upgrading to a bow, and ultimately explosive arrows.[CR]Most stages feature a shop that allows Gizmo to spend points on items and power-ups, including health restoration and balloons that allow him to temporarily recover if he falls into a pit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Last Level[CR]Enter this at the Password screen</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>SunSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<videoid>e9sPgGXnfdw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18670</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585736-gremlins-2-the-new-batch</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/gremlins-2-the-new-batch___</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/gremlins-2-the-new-batch/3030-4028/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18670-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206754-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253292-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213588-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/487968-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488148-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488149-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-introductory.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488150-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488151-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-collect-a-radio.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488152-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-jumping-on-the.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488153-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-the-toolbox-makes.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488154-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-the-bats-in-this.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/488155-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/1093997-gremlins_2_the_new_batch_2.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Gurander Musashi RV (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Gurander Musashi RV (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="E97F2E9A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FGurander%20Musashi%20RV%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="D6FC45FD02E3D7C885C0E0244DC3C8073FB64FF4" size="210540" />		<title_clean>Gurander Musashi RV</title_clean>		<plot>Grander Musashi RV is a Sports game, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai,which was released in Japan in 1998.</plot>		<releasedate>24/7/1998</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/570074-grander-musashi-rv</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/0/1/306501_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/9/gfs_9012_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/9/gfs_9012_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/4/gfs_9012_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/4/gfs_9012_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="HAL Wrestling (USA)">		<description>HAL Wrestling (USA)</description>		<rom crc="5E4A61D3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHAL%20Wrestling%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="861F1CD6EA513A003AB8364B37FA73C63B555E38" size="58606" />		<title_clean>HAL Wrestling</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hal Wrestling is a wrestling game developed by Human Entertainment and published by HAL America for the Game Boy platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The way single matches work in Hal Wrestling is the player is put in a one on one match with a CPU controlled opponent.

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<studio>Bullet-Proof Software</studio>		<nplayers>1-2

A Kebiishi (knight of the past) was entrusted to defend the city.[CR]The game starts with a maze where the kebiishi and some aliens appear.  The aliens start moving through the maze wherever they please.  While trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi digs holes where the aliens will likely travel.

Kevin is armed with a water gun that will, with a few hits, stun the burglars invading his home. There are a few already-set traps like having a bowling ball fall and having a trophy fall on a robber. If the robbers get hold of any jewellery, gold or silver they will run off with it. The NES version is different than all the other versions.[CR]NES Version[CR]Robber hit by trap.[CR]The premise of Home Alone for the NES is to survive 20 minutes against two burglars from the movie - the "Wet Bandits" Harry and Marv. Kevin can do this by hiding behind certain objects, or picking up trap blocks. The trap blocks represent a certain trap via a picture, but they all do the same thing: knock the pursuing burglar out for a short amount of time. Traps can be set anywhere in- or outside the house. After a few uses the traps break. The game also shows the player a map of where they set up traps, however it does not show where the burglars are. After 20 minutes are up the game cuts to an image of the robbers being taken away by the cops.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start on Final Level with All Items[CR]On the title screen, input the following code(s) below.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>THQ Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>1.2</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>20462</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/197568-home-alone</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/home-alone___</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/home-alone/3030-6595/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/11939</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20462-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31933-home-alone-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/261331-home-alone-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68828-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68829-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-daniel-stern.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68830-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-joe-pesci.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68831-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-get-robber-to-follow-you.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68832-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-and-then-he-stands-on-the-trap.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68833-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-use-the-key-to-open-door.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68834-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-in-the-basement.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68835-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-how-do-you-get-past-these.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68836-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-jump-and-they-move.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68837-home-alone-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/xbiBDbd.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York (USA, Europe)">		<description>Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="E8E430F1" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHome%20Alone%202%20-%20Lost%20In%20New%20York%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="853E6F96BCBA40BC4CFA72898B02AEBC3F9D9498" size="83993" />		<title_clean>Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Though based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was in ways worlds different from the movie. Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.[CR]The SNES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the SNES' traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.Levels[CR]Level 1 - The Plaza Hotel[CR]Kevin's first entry to New York is the Plaza Hotel, where his father's stolen credit card helps pay the way for a nice, posh room and ideal room service. But after the hotel workers discover his ruse, he attempts to escape.[CR]Kevin leaps out of the hotel and right into the arms of his old enemies Marv and Harry, who, as well as escaping from prison and attempting to rob the Christmas toy store, have a bone to pick with Kevin and take him away. But after a quick goose on a woman, who in turn socks Marv, Kevin escapes into the confines of Central Park.[CR]Level 2 - Central Park[CR]One of New York's most popular tourist attractions, Central Park is a haven for both glamour (in the daytime) and filth (at night). Kevin enters the park at one of the worst times, having to contend with vermin and urban leeches.[CR]Level 3 - The Uncle's House[CR]Kevin knew he had an uncle who lived in New York and, after much searching, finds his house, noticing it in a state of disrepair and decay. Stones and plaster drop from the ceiling, there are holes in the floors, and several of the doors to get out are locked. Not only that, Harry and Marv have tracked him down and are both searching diligently for him and attempting to steal what remains in the house. But Kevin's set a few of his trademark traps for them to stumble across.[CR]Level 4 - The Chase[CR]After escaping from the house, Marv and Harry give chase to Kevin through the streets of New York. There are two segments to this level.[CR]Segment 1: The player must run away from Harry and Marv while avoiding the additional baddies along the way. The player must must keep running until reaching the giant Christmas tree.[CR]Segment 2: Once inside the Christmas tree, the player needs to climb to the very top and grab the flashing star in order to receive the help of the pigeon lady. The player needs to call for help for her to throw bird seeds on Marv and Harry three times each to properly defeat them and win the game. The player can bounce on the ends of the Christmas tree branches to get higher up on the screen.Reception[CR]The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on. A prominent example is made by The Angry Video Game Nerd, stating that when a key falls towards the player, the player's impulse is to collect it, Instead the key inflicts damage to the player.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Warp[CR]At the Title Screen press Up, Down, Right, Left, and Select.

The player can select which pattern (from pyramids and hourglasses to more complex designs) from which to draw tiles as well as inputting a three letter code which offers several thousand possible combinations of the tiles within that pattern.[CR]Rather than removing tiles in pairs on the edge of the pattern in order to access buried tiles, as is the norm in Shanghai, the player can select any tile on the board as long as it corresponds to the tile the game requests. However, points are scored based on how many other tiles surround the selected tile: A maximum of 320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six sides by other tiles. Any tiles that aren't "standing" on at least one other tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players need to balance earning points by removing entrenched tiles while ensuring that no tile will fall off the table as a result of the removal.[CR]Because the game is not a true version of Shanghai it is named after another Chinese city - Hong Kong - instead.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Codes[CR]Enter all of the following codes on the title screen.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Tokuma Shoten</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575179-hong-kong</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/hong-kong/3030-42961/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2499853-famimaga_hong_kong_fds.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2787011-famimagahongkong001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2499852-famimaga+disk+vol.+1+-+hong+kong+%281990%29%28tokuma+shoten+intermedia%29-3.png</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2499851-famimaga+disk+vol.+1+-+hong+kong+%281990%29%28tokuma+shoten+intermedia%29-2.png</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2499850-famimaga+disk+vol.+1+-+hong+kong+%281990%29%28tokuma+shoten+intermedia%29-1.png</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2499849-famimaga+disk+vol.+1+-+hong+kong+%281990%29%28tokuma+shoten+intermedia%29-0.png</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/f/3/gfs_14769_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/2/3/gfs_14769_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/6/e/gfs_14769_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/b/e/gfs_14769_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>	</game>	<game name="Honmei Boy (Japan)">		<description>Honmei Boy (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="0D255D59" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHonmei%20Boy%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="2D6C460123886502E1590268EC5D8422C5375F7B" size="86534" />		<title_clean>Honmei Boy</title_clean>		<plot>Honmei Boy is a Sports game, published by Nichibutsu,which was released in Japan in 1994.</plot>		<releasedate>7/10/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Nichibutsu</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569528-honmei-boy</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/2/0/306120_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/0/b/gfs_7883_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/d/b/gfs_7883_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/6/b/gfs_7883_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/9/6/gfs_7883_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Honoo no Toukyuuji - Dodge Danpei (Japan)">		<description>Honoo no Toukyuuji - Dodge Danpei (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="BA595897" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHonoo%20no%20Toukyuuji%20-%20Dodge%20Danpei%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="417C22BFD8DBA5DA00C207DA7866D8D8E8B292D1" size="168683" />		<title_clean>Honoo no Toukyuuji - Dodge Danpei</title_clean>		<plot>Honoo no Doukyuuji: Dodge Danpei is a Sports game, published by Hudson,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>24/4/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Hudson</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569735-honoo-no-doukyuuji-dodge-danpei</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/5/30385_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/d/gfs_7330_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/a/d/gfs_7330_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/0/gfs_7330_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/3/0/gfs_7330_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/4/gfs_7330_3_1.jpg</snapshot5>	</game>	<game name="Hook (USA)">		<description>Hook (USA)</description>		<rom crc="6765B61B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHook%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="570D7CC03E80E199E856160912431C21A6CA0F6C" size="103857" />		<title_clean>Hook</title_clean>		<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Mode[CR]At the Title Screen press Right, Up, Up, Down, Down, Right, Left, Up.You will hear a confirmation sound.</plot>		<releasedate>14/4/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Sony Imagesoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.1</rating>		<videoid>AWDA5P6QPw4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20469</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585746-hook</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/hook</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/hook/3030-23656/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20469-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53666-hook-genesis-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53667-hook-genesis-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/85726-hook-snes-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/61260-hook-snes-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51619-hook-game-gear-screenshot-the-story.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51620-hook-game-gear-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51621-hook-game-gear-screenshot-tinkerbell-appears.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51618-hook-game-gear-screenshot-crouching-attack.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51622-hook-game-gear-screenshot-pan-jumps.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51623-hook-game-gear-screenshot-dying-peter.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51624-hook-game-gear-screenshot-pan-vs-lost-boy.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51625-hook-game-gear-screenshot-pan-jumping-to-next-platform.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/617365-hook-game-gear-screenshot-showdown-with-rufio.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/617367-hook-game-gear-screenshot-rufio-acknowledges-we-re-peter-pan.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Hoshi no Kirby 2 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Hoshi no Kirby 2 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="4BEDF22C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHoshi%20no%20Kirby%202%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="8487FCC3F9005F6C6819C3D5810F54E78B510D47" size="331023" />		<title_clean>Hoshi no Kirby 2</title_clean>		<plot>The Rainbow Bridges have disappeared!

With Gametek's Sega Genesis version of HUMANS, the only missing link is you!</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>GameTek</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>2.9</rating>		<videoid>KwmuUl0Lv54</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20464</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585747-the-humans</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/humans</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20464-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224585-the-humans-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224586-the-humans-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162700-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162701-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162702-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-game-story.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162703-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162704-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-level-1-s-goal.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162705-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-starting-location.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162706-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-this-man-is-set-so-he-can-be.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162707-the-humans-game-boy-screenshot-got-that-spear.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/8/0/gfs_38619_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/5/0/gfs_38619_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Hunchback of Notre Dame, The - 5 Foolishly Fun Topsy Turvy Games (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Hunchback of Notre Dame, The - 5 Foolishly Fun Topsy Turvy Games (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="3A4636FF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHunchback%20of%20Notre%20Dame%2C%20The%20-%205%20Foolishly%20Fun%20Topsy%20Turvy%20Games%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="DE0310602E675924F393140B3FA66284870661DD" size="185458" />		<title_clean>Hunchback of Notre Dame, The - 5 Foolishly Fun Topsy Turvy Games</title_clean>		<plot>Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame is an Action game, developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios, which was released in 1997.</plot>		<releasedate>1/3/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<thegamesdb_id>21654</thegamesdb_id>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21654-1.jpg</boxart1>	</game>	<game name="Hunt for Red October, The (USA, Europe)">		<description>Hunt for Red October, The (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="5A61EE00" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FHunt%20for%20Red%20October%2C%20The%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="7C9CCFD9E98B30C33FF71B3AB3098C2AFEB9037C" size="87716" />		<title_clean>Hunt for Red October, The</title_clean>		<plot>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. [CR]You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hi-Tech Expressions</studio>		<nplayers>1-2

Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as "Slick's Great Challenge") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, "...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Cheat Mode[CR]Input the following code(s) on the title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the cheat mode code above, then enter one of the following passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Two Player Game mode[CR]On the title screen, press Select, Select, and Start.</plot>		<releasedate>5/11/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>LJN</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>4.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18689</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585752-the-incredible-crash-dummies</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/incredible-crash-dummies</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-incredible-crash-dummies/3030-20029/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18689-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114132-the-incredible-crash-dummies-genesis-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114133-the-incredible-crash-dummies-genesis-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82685-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82686-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-watch-out-slick.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82687-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-slick-is-down.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82688-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-jumping-parking.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82689-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-a-damaged-car.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82690-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-jump-on-the-spinning.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82691-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-slick-jumping.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82692-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-a-dummy-on-a.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82693-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-the-crash-center.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/82694-the-incredible-crash-dummies-amiga-screenshot-slick-curls-himself.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18689.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Indiana Jones - Saigo no Seisen (Japan)">		<description>Indiana Jones - Saigo no Seisen (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="8F234F49" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FIndiana%20Jones%20-%20Saigo%20no%20Seisen%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="238499F9FC98183E57222E8F1271B9BBAD2AF3EC" size="84707" />		<title_clean>Indiana Jones - Saigo no Seisen</title_clean>		<plot>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an Action game, developed by NMS Software and published by Ubisoft,which was released in 1994.</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>NMS Software</studio>		<thegamesdb_id>21656</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585753-indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21656-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/3/0/46330_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/9/gfs_82493_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/3/9/gfs_82493_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/4/gfs_82493_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/a/4/gfs_82493_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (USA, Europe)">		<description>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="9189921A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FIndiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="B656BA6C03D0CB5C81C2ED8C5C64EA8E36660AAA" size="88492" />		<title_clean>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</title_clean>		<plot>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary.[CR]This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-the-action-game[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Ubisoft</studio>		<thegamesdb_id>21656</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585753-indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21656-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/3/0/46330_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/9/gfs_82493_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/3/9/gfs_82493_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/4/gfs_82493_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/a/4/gfs_82493_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Indien dans la Ville, Un (France) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Indien dans la Ville, Un (France) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="E37E1832" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FIndien%20dans%20la%20Ville%2C%20Un%20%28France%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="168337CDD8E4D919CE3B62EA4802EC6B959C6893" size="89650" />		<title_clean>Indien dans la Ville, Un</title_clean>		<plot>Un Indien Dans La Ville is an Action game, developed and published by Titus Software,which was released in Europe in 1995.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Skip[CR]Pause the game and press Right 4 times, Down 3 times, Left 2 times, and Up once.You will hear a sound if done correctly, press Select to skip to the next stage.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>Titus Software</studio>		<rating>6.0</rating>		<videoid>1nFpb7b9HTQ</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/961097-un-indien-dans-la-ville</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/9/2/114692_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/9/2/114692_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/8/0/gfs_126679_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/5/0/gfs_126679_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/1/d/gfs_126679_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/c/d/gfs_126679_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/7/d/gfs_126679_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/6/d/gfs_126679_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/d/gfs_126679_2_5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/0/d/gfs_126679_2_6.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/b/d/gfs_126679_2_7.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/6/c/gfs_126679_2_8.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="InfoGenius Productivity Pak -

It was released on the Super Famicom in late 1994 and on Super Nintendo in mid-1995. The game introduces the franchise's trademark view of the pitch, using a slightly askew angled view that nonetheless scrolls horizontally. It also uses realistic proportions for its athletes and focuses more on realism than many of its contemporaries.[CR]The game would be followed by International Superstar Soccer Deluxe the subsequent year. In Japan the game is a sequel, where it is known as Jikkyou World Soccer 2: Fighting Eleven, but is treated more of an enhanced edition of the original overseas. Many sequels would follow on the N64, PS1, Saturn and PS2. International Superstar Soccer and its sequels would later go on to influence Konami's later ISS Pro and PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) franchises.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1998</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Konami of America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21613</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/570020-international-superstar-soccer</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/international-superstar-soccer_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/international-superstar-soccer/3030-6106/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5211</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21613-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154714-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/158949-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429554-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-opening.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429555-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429556-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429557-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429558-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429559-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-playing.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429560-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-playing.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429561-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-set-your.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429562-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-it-s-paraguay.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/429563-international-superstar-soccer-game-boy-screenshot-call-the.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ippatsu Gyakuten!

As this grid fills up and both the available remaining spaces and stones become fewer in number, the challenge ratchets up. The game presents itself as an ancient Chinese board game like Mahjong, Go or Shogi but with a slight mystical quality regarding the astrology-like symbols on the stones.[CR]The game was originally released for the Macintosh home computer, but was quickly ported to various other computers and systems in the east and west. As was the case with the many versions of Tetris, the simple rules of Ishido made it possible for it to be easily replicated by many companies that all honored the original creators in the credits. Accolade were responsible for many of the western home computer ports while the small Japanese development studio Hiro was responsible for the Famicom Disk System version.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>ASCII Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21658</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585755-ishido-the-way-of-stones</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/ishido-the-way-of-stones</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ishido-the-way-of-stones/3030-20000/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21658-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67902-ishido-the-way-of-stones-amiga-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67903-ishido-the-way-of-stones-amiga-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131610-ishido-the-way-of-stones-amiga-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/41893-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/41894-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/236329-ishido-the-way-of-stones-macintosh-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15808-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-title-screen-vga.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15809-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-gameplay-options-vga.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15810-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-credits-vga.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15811-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-choosing-a-different.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15812-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-end-of-game-losing.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15814-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-title-screen-ega-tandy.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15815-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-gameplay-options-ega.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15816-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-a-winning-game-but.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15818-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-title-screen-cga.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/15822-ishido-the-way-of-stones-dos-screenshot-a-winning-game-without.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Itsudemo!

It is named for and features the likeness of prodigious professional golfer Jack Nicklaus, and frequently references his nickname "the Golden Bear" in the game.[CR]The game has a lot of customization options and two 18-hole courses. The player can create their own course by selecting holes from either course in any order. The player can also select to practice by either choosing a hole to try out, a putting green on which to practice putting or a driving range to get used to the swing controls.[CR]Before each hole, Jack Nicklaus dispenses some advice. It can be related to the hole, or just a useful tip in general.

James Bond 007 was the first game developed by the now defunct             Saffire. The game features notable supporting characters from the Bond fiction like             Oddjob,             Jaws and Q.  [CR]Plot [CR]The story begins in a Chinese Village to which bond must infiltrate and steal some plans. The village is run by a female marital artist, and this makes the task difficult. Bond succeeds and takes the plans back to London where he is then sent on various missions to halt an evil plan by Oddjob. Ultimately your goal in the game is to stop Oddjob from succeeding, but you will fail often against him throughout the game. Bond will undergo          torture and imprisonment before eventually stopping Oddjob.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The game is played from a         top down perspective, and the visual style is very similar to        Links Awakening for the       Game Boy. You will travel to different towns and talk to various      non playable characters, this Bond doesn't shoot first and talk later. You will find various areas in the game world that cannot be accessed until you find the proper equipment, and this is where     Zelda elements really come in. You will gain weapons to fight enemies throughout the game, but you can also punch and kick as an alternate form of combat. Gameplay does occasionally strays from the Zelda formula through stealth missions. These missions mainly consist of the player    sneaking by enemies and through different environments. A level set in Marrakech,   Morocco features a  casino where you need to play Baccarat and             BlackJack in order to gain access to a high roller's lounge.

shady toy factory he wakes up in. To do so, he needs a series of objects before the elevator operator will allow him to take the elevator to the roof and escape the compound. The objects can be found in six separate worlds and Jelly Boy must explore all of them to earn his freedom.[CR]As well as jumping, attacking (using a fist that extends out of his stomach) and ducking (which literally turns him into a duck), Jelly Boy is able to employ various abilities by collecting power-ups that resemble him. These power-ups will transform him into a new shape which the player can use to progress or find treasure.Abilities[CR]A partial list of these special abilities include:Hammer - Jelly Boy's upper body changes into that of a hammer, which allows him to smash through specific walls to progress.Balloon - Jelly Boy inflates, allowing him to rise and fall through the air. He is also able to fire pellets to attack airborne enemies.Submarine - Jelly Boy becomes a Submarine, able to travel through water and shoot torpedoes.Ball - Jelly Boy becomes a sphere, allowing greater jumping power but harder-to-control movement in general.Brick - Jelly Boy becomes a brick. All he can do is tip over and lie there until the power-up is canceled.[CR]As well as reaching the end of the stage before the timer runs out, Jelly Boy also needs to collect a hidden puzzle piece on each one. These pieces will unlock that world's boss which needs to be defeated for the all-important World Item needed for the elevator. Also hidden on one of the stages in each world is a key. This key is vital as it is required to open up the next world, which the player can choose in any order (though the Toy World is always the default first world). He can also collect musical notes, which have a similar protective property to Sonic's rings: If Jelly Boy is hit, he will lose all his notes instead of dying.[CR]Helping Jelly Boy is Helpy Block, a block that doesn't mind being smacked around so it can be positioned to assist Jelly Boy get higher up. Also helping, in his own way, is Harry the Dog, who does nothing but bark at enemies ineffectually and can be punched for the sheer cruelty factor.[CR]The game was never released outside of Europe. It is available on SNES and Game Boy.

On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. [CR]While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.[CR]While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>2.7</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>20481</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585764-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one/3030-16685/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20481-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/20481-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/231216-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285829-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285830-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285831-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-set-features.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285832-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-the-start.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285833-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-bird-in-action.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285834-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-throw.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285835-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-m-j-got-no-chance.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285836-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-another-point.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285838-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-airy.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285839-jordan-vs-bird-one-on-one-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-way-to.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Judge Dredd (USA, Europe)">		<description>Judge Dredd (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="B9D11656" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FJudge%20Dredd%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="36266C67C4FB095566401C25B11981785AC20A7D" size="159690" />		<title_clean>Judge Dredd</title_clean>		<plot>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.

Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike and Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, who threaten the United States with nuclear weapons.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays from an isometric perspective and is broken down into specific missions that need to be accomplished on each level. These range from attacking certain locations to defending objectives. Should any of the objectives result in a failure, the player must restart the level from the beginning. Before each level, players choose a co-pilot to help them, which gives the players semi-automatic to automatic fire on the machine guns. During the missions, fuel, ammunition, and armor all  factor into the gameplay. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike, plots his revenge against the United States by allying himself with Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, and announces his domiance by dropping a nuke on an island somewhere in the Pacific. STRIKE quickly send their top agent to secure the President and the surrounding D.C. area against terrorist attack. After securing the President, STRIKE moves to nullify Kilbaba's nuclear capability and control of specific regions. Being pushed back to the mountains, Kilbaba and the Drug Lord put up a strong resistance in their fortress, but are captured and taken back to the United States. However, both are able to escape following an attack on the Capitol. In the end, Kilbaba's escape in a gasoline truck is cut short and the Drug Lord is presumed dead after attempting to flee in a bus. With both leaders out of commission and a nuclear crisis averted in Washington D.C., the world is once again safe from fanatical leaders.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Malibu Games</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<videoid>A5ErDFb1wYU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20484</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585768-jungle-strike</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/jungle-strike</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/jungle-strike/3030-2180/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20484-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/20484-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21129-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21130-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-briefing.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21131-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-looks-familiar.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21133-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-campaign-co-pilot-selection.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21134-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-the-white-house-is-home-base.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21135-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-map.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21136-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-protect-the-washington-monument.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21137-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-vw-minibus-attacking-the.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21138-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-pick-up-the-navy-seals.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21140-jungle-strike-game-boy-screenshot-drop-off-the-seals.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Jungle Wars (Japan)">		<description>Jungle Wars (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="2AD46AC7" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FJungle%20Wars%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="3835A7821C11197FCA87564B8D51A82C81FA7286" size="177986" />		<title_clean>Jungle Wars</title_clean>		<plot>Jungle Wars is a Role-Playing game, developed by Atelier Double and published by Pony Canyon,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>21/6/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Atelier Double</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569708-jungle-wars</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/0/30380_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/4/4/gfs_7712_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/2/4/gfs_7712_1_3.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/9/gfs_7712_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/0/9/gfs_7712_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/b/9/gfs_7712_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/a/9/gfs_7712_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/1/9/gfs_7712_2_5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/c/9/gfs_7712_2_6.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/7/9/gfs_7712_2_7.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/a/8/gfs_7712_2_8.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Jurassic Park (USA)">		<description>Jurassic Park (USA)</description>		<rom crc="B350BEDF" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FJurassic%20Park%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="66273F0B52F9FF2BE875B1428ADD267A5F01ADB0" size="166082" />		<title_clean>Jurassic Park</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jurassic Park is an action game released on multiple systems to tie-in with the movie of the same name. In each version of the game the player takes on the role of Dr Alan Grant and follows the events of the movie (and the book it is based on).[CR]There are numerous differences between the various versions. The titles on Nintendo's platforms were handled by Ocean Software while Sega's titles were developed by BlueSky Software.[CR]The 1993 Sega CD version, which is an a point and click adventure game rather than an action game, has a separate page here.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]A Tyrannosaurus breaks through the wall of the power plant.[CR]BlueSky's Genesis title is a 2D platformer which allowed the player to play as either Dr. Grant or a Velociraptor while they attempted to escape Isla Nublar. Since the game began development before the film had been completed the designers had to borrow heavily from the novel for stages. With additions like the pump station and river levels being ripped directly from the novel.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] when selecting Dr. Grant is a standard side-scrolling action platformer. As he attempts to escape the island he amasses an arsenal of non-lethal weapons such as darts, smoke grenades, and tasers. This character's series of levels leads him through locales such as a power plant, a river (where he pilots a motorboat), and the interior of an active volcano. Grant's finale sees him reaching the visitor's center and escaping the island via helicopter.The hunt continues.[CR]Opting to play as the Velociraptor gives the player access to a completely different arsenal, namely the raptor's claws. The raptor's main goals are to eventually defeat Dr. Grant and reach the mainland. Playing through each level will require the raptor to defeat armed guards still stationed on the island as well as other hostile dinosaurs. The raptor's campaign is noticeably shorter than Grant's, completely skipping levels such as the volcano and river. Completing the game as the raptor shows that it successfully escaped the island by concealing itself in a crate that is loaded into a cargo ship.[CR]After the successful sales of the Genesis version BlueSky released a sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game were similar to the Genesis version, but developed by Sega separately in Japan and didn't feature the raptor protagonist.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The SNES version of Jurassic Park is incredibly different from its Genesis counterpart. In the game the player controls Grant from a top down perspective and is given the task of collecting a number of velociraptor eggs before they hatch. Along with a much more cartoony and brighter look, it also has first-person indoor sections in the same vein as Doom where Grant has to collect key cards and codes for use outside.[CR]For the most part, the game is very open-ended, not unlike some earlier Zelda games. The game requires Grant to do a lot of backtracking and hunting for items which helps progress the player through the story. Unfortunately the game has no save or password function so the player would have to collect all of the eggs in one sitting, a very daunting task with lots of trial-and-error gameplay involved.[CR]Game Gear Version[CR]The Game Gear version has more in common with the Genesis version, being a side-scrolling shooter. With the only weapon being a pistol, the player once again assumes the role of Dr. Grant. Progression from level to level is non-linear, giving the player the option to choose which area of the island they want to tackle first. Before the actual side-scrolling segments of each zone the player would play through a vehicle segment. In these segments the player would shoot down dinosaurs pursuing the jeep, successfully clearing these levels granted bonuses. Each level is unique in its design, showcasing a different area of the island, complete with a boss fight at the end. Clearing all the selectable levels opened the Visitor Center finale, where Grant would be confronted by the park's Tyrannosaurus.[CR]Game Boy &amp; NES Versions[CR]The NES and Game Boy versions were basically the same game.[CR]Like the SNES Jurassic Park, the Game Boy and NES versions were also developed by Ocean Software. Also similar to the SNES version, the main goal of each stage is to simply collect a certain number of dinosaur eggs, opening access to the next area. Blocking progress through these stages is an assortment of dinosaurs, including main enemies like velociraptors, procompsognathus, and dilophosaurus. To deal with these threats, the player is given one primary weapon, bearing a strong resemblance to a rocket launcher. As Grant kills dinosaurs they drop ammunition for his armament.

In response Ocean, the development house responsible for the original titles, began work on a sequel.[CR]In 1994 The Chaos Continues was released for the Game Boy and Super Nintendo. For the new game, Ocean took a new design. Unlike the original games, which were all mainly top-down perspective games, The Chaos Continues was a side-scrolling shooter. It also had an animated opening cutscene for the SNES version.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The version for the Super Nintendo is a standard sidescroller. Upon starting a new game the player is confronted with a menu screen that gives them several missions to choose from. Completing one mission brings them back to select another. Finishing missions progresses the player through the game. The main plot is that the bio-engineering company Biosyn, rival to John Hammond's InGen, dispatched troops to Isla Nublar to take control of the facilities and the dinosaurs. Hammond asks Dr. Alan Grant and soldier Michael Wolfskin to head to the island and stop Biosyn.[CR]The game's arsenal consists of a charging stun gun, machine guns, and shotguns. Utilizing the stun gun is an important factor in the game, because killing too many non-velociraptor enemies results in the island's ecosystem being destroyed, leading to the game over screen.[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The GB version has a much different look than the SNES version.[CR]The Game Boy version is also a side-scrolling shooter, but it unfolds slightly differently. Abandoning the mission structure of the SNES version, the Game Boy version progresses strictly linearly. The game is divided into a series of similarly themed levels called zones. Most zones have two levels which requires the player to gather a set number of key cards in order to open a gate at the end of the level, with the third level being a boss battle.[CR]Interspersed between these normal zones is the occasional T-rex zone, which requires navigating a maze-like level while a Tyrannosaurus chased the player character. Collecting all the keycards in these levels resulted in an extra continue.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Skip[CR]Pause the game and press Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B.

"For the Frog the Bell Tolls" is an action-RPG developed by Nintendo and released for the Game Boy in 1992. This obscure Japan-only action RPG was the basis for several key gameplay elements in Link's Awakening. The player takes on the roll of Prince of Sabure who, along with his childhood rival, Prince Richard, embark on their quest to rescue the Princess of Mille-Feuille, whose kingdom has been invaded by the Croakian army led by King Delarin. The game received an English fan translation in 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is a mix between an action-RPG and platformer. The player initiates combat by walking into enemies in the world, where a fighting animation plays out and the two characters fight automatically until there is a winner. The winner is dependent on who has the most defense and offensive abilities, each character will do an amount of damage (taking away heart pieces) per turn and in the case of standard enemies, there is no interaction beyond combat initiation. The player can increase their skills by picking up objects that increase health, speed and strength and by purchasing items such as better shields. As there is no skill in combat itself, the strategy involves choosing which enemies to fight and which ones to avoid. If the player has too few heartpieces, they will have to fight weaker enemies in the hope of obtaining hearts, drink wine that can be purchased from the town, or go back to the town and visit a doctor. If the player dies, they are sent back to the doctor in the nearest town.[CR]The other part of the game is platforming in the game's dungeons, which is where the unique feature of the game comes into play. During the course of the game, the Prince is transformed into a frog. A frog can jump higher, instantly defeat small enemies by eating them (receiving a health bonus) and swim in water. Frogs cannot do any damage to larger enemies and will thus lose in a fight to them. The player can only turn into a frog by entering water and can transfer back to a human by eating Joy Fruit. The player also receives the ability to transform into a snake, who can get into small nooks that the frog and human cannot gain access to, however their jumping is extremely low. Unlike the frog, the player can transform into the snake at any time by eating a snake egg. Like the frog, the player can transform back into a human by eating Joy Fruit. Several areas in the game require the player to use all 3 forms in conjunction to solve a particular puzzle.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, RPG</genre>		<studio>Nintendo Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>22491</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569755-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru/3030-10205/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10783</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22491-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/9/6/30396_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199369-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199370-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-prince-richard.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199371-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-sable-throws.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199372-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-exploring.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199373-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-some-deadly.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199374-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-bump-into.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199375-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-sable-has.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199376-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-a-mysterious.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199377-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-the-castle.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/199378-kaeru-no-tame-ni-kane-wa-naru-game-boy-screenshot-when-in.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/rUs0OMs.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Kaijuu Ou Gojira (Japan)">		<description>Kaijuu Ou Gojira (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="C529A96A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKaijuu%20Ou%20Gojira%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="56271383F34A7709668A982DF95EBD083831E30F" size="122187" />		<title_clean>Kaijuu Ou Gojira</title_clean>	</game>	<game name="Kaisen Game - Navy Blue (Japan)">		<description>Kaisen Game - Navy Blue (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="AFD8C47C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKaisen%20Game%20-%20Navy%20Blue%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="7FBF13DD0B5A4E7798724270A81006BE9950F81A" size="30317" />		<title_clean>Kaisen Game - Navy Blue</title_clean>		<plot>Do you have what it takes to command your own fleet of six ships?

It had the MLB license but not the license of the Player's Union, so fictionalized names (other than Griffey's) were used for the athletes. The fictional names are notable for the various themes that teams were given. For example, the Kansas City Royals were all named after United States presidents and the Baltimore Orioles are named after famous Baltimoreans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features exhibition and season play, as well as a 1 or 2-player Home Run Derby mode. When pitching, the player can control the path of the ball in midair, which can make 2-player competitive play sometimes infuriating. Aside from this, basic gameplay is fairly straightforward. In-game stadiums resemble their real-life equivalents and include well-known features like Fenway Park's left field wall (the Green Monster) and Baltimore's brick facade of the B &amp; O warehouse beyond right field that Ken Griffey struck with a ball during 1993's Home Run Derby.[CR]Fictional Name Team Themes[CR]Atlanta Braves - Famous DJsBaltimore Orioles - Baltimore nativesBoston Red Sox - Cheers (TV Show) characters and Boston landmarksCalifornia Angels - Famous actorsChicago White Sox - Basketball players from St. John's UniversityChicago Cubs - Sports actions or nicknamesCincinnati Reds - Prolific writersCleveland Indians - Famous ActressesColorado Rockies - Famous people associated with horror moviesDetroit Tigers - Motown singersHouston Astros - CartoonistsKansas City Royals - Presidents of the United States of AmericaLos Angeles Dodgers - Punk rockers and other musicians from CaliforniaMilwaukee Brewers - Secret agents, detectives, and superhero secret identitiesMinnesota Twins - Book charactersMontreal Expos - 1980's English musiciansNew York Mets - Punk rockers from New YorkNew York Yankees - Former Yankee greatsOakland Athletics - Prolific authorsPhiladelphia Phillies - Philly landmarks and characters from the Rocky moviesSan Francisco Giants - Workers from Software CreationsSan Diego Padres - Punk rockers from EnglandSeattle Mariners - Workers from Nintendo of AmericaSt. Louis Cardinals - ComediansTexas Rangers - Western motifToronto Blue Jays - Wigan Warriors rugby team members[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fast Home Run Derby[CR]When you are in Home Run Derby, and the computer is up, hold B and down while the pitcher pitches it and it will skip the computers entire round, giving him a random final score.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Nintendo</studio>		<rating>8.7</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21592</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/564354-ken-griffey-jr-presents-major-league-baseball</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ken-griffey-jr-presents-major-league-baseball/3030-7266/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21592-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/4/24134_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2736039-kengriffey002.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2736038-kengriffey001.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2736037-ken+griffey+jr.+presents+major+league+baseball+%28u%29_00001.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2736036-ken+griffey+jr.+presents+major+league+baseball+%28u%29_00000.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1463/292501-ken_griffey_jr._presents_major_league_baseball_snes_screenshot2.jpg.gif</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/56/227644-gfs_47102_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/0/c/gfs_29452_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/d/c/gfs_29452_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/6/c/gfs_29452_1_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/7/c/gfs_29452_1_4.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba (Japan)">		<description>Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="CC19768E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKenyuu%20Densetsu%20Yaiba%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="C2B71CEEE21F66F462DF18233F7622D8EC95FCCA" size="117971" />		<title_clean>Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba ("Legend of the Swordmaster Yaiba") is a video game adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name about the samurai youth Yaiba who is the latest incarnation of the Thunder God. The lighthearted manga/anime takes its inspiration from Japanese folklore, but transplants it into a modern setting.[CR]The game is an action RPG, where the protagonist fights monsters in real-time without transitioning to a separate battle screen. The game loosely follows the first arc of its source material, in which Yaiba must defeat his rival Onimaru and the various demons he summons (many of whom end up joining Yaiba's party after being defeated, becoming support characters). Yaiba has a number of AI support characters, including his faithful vulture companion Shonosuke, who will fly Yaiba back to the nearest safehouse for healing/saving. Others include Yaiba's love interest Sayaka, who can use cure magic to heal Yaiba, and Kagetora, Yaiba's tiger companion who fights alongside him. The game also has a two-player mode where the second player controls Rai; a character created for the game.[CR]Banpresto published Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba for the Super Famicom, Game Boy and Sega Game Gear in 1994. The portable versions are side-scrolling action games, whereas the Super Famicom action RPG uses a top-down perspective.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>25/3/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Banpresto</studio>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<videoid>_-eE9eWB2Do</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569894-kenyuu-densetsu-yaiba</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kenyuu-densetsu-yaiba/3030-4906/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/5/59247/1145249-kenyuu.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/9/3/30493_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739248-kenyuudensetsuyaiba001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739247-kenyuu+densetsu+yaiba+%28j%29_00004.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739246-kenyuu+densetsu+yaiba+%28j%29_00003.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739245-kenyuu+densetsu+yaiba+%28j%29_00002.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739244-kenyuu+densetsu+yaiba+%28j%29_00001.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739243-kenyuu+densetsu+yaiba+%28j%29_00000.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/b/4/gfs_7591_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/6/4/gfs_7591_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/4/gfs_7591_1_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/c/4/gfs_7591_1_4.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Kick Boxing, The (Japan)">		<description>Kick Boxing, The (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="8056344C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKick%20Boxing%2C%20The%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="6FB48835E5401D7B559B7E97C020BC8C356DFA1F" size="122112" />		<title_clean>Kick Boxing, The</title_clean>		<plot>The ancient art of Karate, you have been obsessed with its mystical magic and power.

It was published by Midway on the arcade, and by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. The game is well-known for the large amount of combos that a player can dole out.[CR]Nintendo originally planned Killer Instinct for early release on the Nintendo 64. Killer Instinct and Cruis'n USA were actually among the first Nintendo 64 games announced. When manufacturing issues delayed the system's release, Nintendo debuted Killer Instinct on the SNES instead in late 1995. The N64 would instead get a port of Killer Instinct 2 entitled Killer Instinct Gold the year after.[CR]The game received a Xbox One port, which featured a training mode, the ability to pick different revisions of the game, and Xbox achievements. The game was included with the purchase of "Killer Instinct Season 1 Ultra Edition". Developed by Code Mystics.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fulgore vs. Orchid[CR]Killer Instinct uses a basic 2D fighting layout, where players face each other from opposite sides of an arena and move primarily left and right, attacking from standing, jumping, or crouching positions. Its gameplay expanded on other 1990s fighters in important ways, including match format, multi-part combo system, and through the introduction of "breakers."[CR]Prior to Killer Instinct, most fighting games (including Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat) used a strict "best of three" round system. Both players started with the same amount of energy, fought until one side ran out, and restarted the fight. Killer Instinct replaced this with a 2-stage life bar where matches reset when a player loses half their life, but the "leader" keeps their current amount. (This makes "perfect" rounds more challenging, as victors must drain both bars without taking damage.)[CR]Killer Instinct's basic joystick and button controls closely resemble Street Fighter. Its six attacks use three strengths of punches and kicks, weak, medium, and strong. Players block by holding the stick away from their opponent (and not attacking). Most special moves use quarter-circle, half-circle, or back-forward joystick movements followed by an attack. Character-specific special moves also serve as openers to a combo chain.Combo Attack System[CR]Killer Instinct features a multi-stage attack system whose structure encouraged mastery of both basic attacks (as openers) and "continuers," moves that build into long, visually impressive combos.Combo opener: special move or jumping attack that leaves opponent "open" to combo (each character has several openers)Continuer: performed after successful opener and adds 2-4 hits; joystick + button move that's typically one "up" from the opener (weak to medium, medium to strong, strong to weak)Linker: joystick + button move that adds 2-3 hits (exact move is character-specific)Finisher: joystick + button move after linker and adds 3-4 hits (knocks opponent to ground and ends combo)[CR]An unbroken, 4-part combo scores about a dozen hits, depending on the characters and moves used. (Note that the player only performs 4 distinct button presses.) Killer Instinct's combo system created longer attacks with fewer actions than most other fighting games, a system designers created to encourage deeper knowledge of each character and limit the success of "button mashing."[CR]On defense, players can break attacker combos with a character-specific stick + button move at the start of any continuer, linker, or finisher (see Combo Breakers). Breakers end the combo's "flow" and knock the attacker back. (The match announcer says one of this game's distinctive lines, "C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER," on successful breakers.) Players must have energy in their life bar to break a combo; attackers who drain the final amount with an opener can continue their combo uninterrupted.Finishing Opponents[CR]Once attackers deplete an opponent's life bar, they can finish opponents a la Mortal Kombat with a violent "No Mercy" move or Humiliation, which forces the opponent to dance. (Humiliations require the victor to still be on their first life bar.)[CR]Attackers can also trigger an "Ultra Combo" (a knockout sequence consisting of 20+ hits) by inputting a character-specific move during their combo chain when an opponent's life bar flashes red (under 10% left). The game automates ultra finishing sequences, requiring no further button pressing; arcade players often removed their hands from the machine to accentuate their win and watch the combo play out.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Killer Cuts was a soundtrack album that was released and packaged with the video game Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo in 1995. Many of the tracks were arranged and included the character's theme songs in addition to the songs featured in the fighting stages. Although exclusive to the pack-in with the game, it could be bought via the Nintendo Power magazine catalog.Killer Cuts front coverK.I. Feeling ( B.

Track 30 is the song used in the Humiliation finishers/dances.[CR]Announcer[CR]The game was also famous for the announcer, who announced the combos after their completion as well as the iconic Combo Breaker. There were 11 types of combos, each with a distinctive name and delivery.3 hits: Triple combo4 hits: Super combo5 hits: Hyper combo6 hits: Brutal combo7 hits: Master combo8 hits: Awesome combo9 hits: Blaster combo10 hits: Monster combo11 hits: King combo12 hits: Killer comboFinishing combo: Ultra combo (20+ hits)[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A mega-corporation (mega-corporations have completely replaced governments in this future) named Ultratech organizes a tournament consisting of fights to the death. Ultratech has entered some of their experimental prototypes in the contest, as well as other entrants. Most of the other entrants have some sort of motivation to joining the contest, usually due to something that Ultratech has promised them (for example, in Sabrewulf's case, Ultratech promises to heal him of his lycantrophy) Ultratech discovers a way to unleash an ancient warrior named Eyedol and enters him into the tournament.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageFulgore Fulgore is a cyborg who is the result of a cybernetic project at Ultratech. He, like other Ultratech experiments, was entered into the tournament as a test. If it was able to win, it would be produced in mass quantities. However, it was defeated by Jago.Cinder Cinder is a criminal who was promised a release from jail if he was tested on with chemical weapons. As a result, his body has been turned into fire. If he is able to defeat Glacius in the tournament, then he will return to his original form.Glacius An alien who was captured by Ultratech, Glacius was promised freedom if he wins the tournament. His body is composed of ice and water, making him able to shapeshift.Jago Jago is a Tibetan monk who follows the Tiger Spirit (who later ends up to be Gargos). Jago is on the search for enlightenment, and wants to defeat Ultratech (he believes it is his destiny).Riptor A velociraptor that has been genetically engineered by Ultratech. It is a prototype; it is a test to determine its abilities.Sabrewulf A normal human who has been transformed into a werewolf, and is promised the cure if he wins the tournament. He is likely a reference to Rare's game Sabre Wulf.Spinal Spinal is a skeleton who, through cell regeneration, is made living. He is the remains of an ancient warrior, and unlike many others participating in the tournament, fights for enjoyment. His brain could not regenerate in the process, so this is probably the reason why.TJ Combo TJ Combo is a boxer who was kicked out of his position of champion after it was discovered that his arms had cybernetic implants that improved his boxing ability. Ultratech promises him back his championship if he wins the contest.Chief Thunder Chief Thunder is a Native American who enters the tournament to find out what happened to his long lost brother Eagle. It is later revealed that his long lost brother is actually Spinal.B. Orchid A spy for an unknown entity, she is a secretary for Ultratech. Jago and B. Orchid are essentially the protagonists of the game.Eyedol The final boss of the game, Eyedol is a two-headed, ancient mystical warlord who was trapped in a dimensional prison in the distant past. Ultratech released him to be the final combatant in the tournament. It is shown in Killer Instinct 2 that the person Eyedol was trapped in combat with was Gargos, the final boss of that game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]While on the title screen push the following button sequences:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Pick any character.

The American Sports Team is also replaced by the Rivals Team, featuring Fatal Fury rival Billy Kane, Art of Fighting rival Eiji Kisaragi, and the popular Iori Yagami, rival to Kyo Kusanagi. The story is similar to the previous game, as Rugal Bernstein hosts a tournament featuring the strongest warriors.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay was still the same as its previous title but a few alterations and additions were made to this game. Unlike The King of Fighters 94 where a fixed team of 3 is chosen to each fight, the concept of "Team Edit" was added where the player can choose any 3 characters from any of the teams.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Japan TeamKyo KusanagiBenimaru NikaidoGoro DaimonFatal Fury TeamTerry BogardAndy BogardJoe HigashiArt of Fighting TeamRyo SakazakiRobert GarciaTakuma SakazakiIkari Warriors TeamHeidernRalf JonesClark SteelPsycho Soldier TeamAthena AsamiyaSie KensouChin GentsaiWomen Fighters TeamYuri SakazakiMai ShiranuiKingKorea TeamKim KaphwanChang KoehanChoi BoungeRivals TeamIori Yagami (new character)Eiji Kisaragi (new character)Billy Kane (new character)OtherSaisyu Kusanagi (sub-boss) (new character)Rugal Bernstein (boss)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Character Select[CR]Press Start + A + B together on the Character Selection screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Character Select[CR]Enter these codes when the Takara logo appears when starting the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight Nakoruru.[CR]Beat the game on Hard difficulty.

Each world is comprised of 5 different stages, including a boss stage at the end of the world. Levels 1-3 are standard fare, simply asking players to break all the bricks in the level before moving on. One thing that made Kirby's Block Ball unique is the fact that players always use two paddles simultaneously on levels 1-3, one on the top and one on the bottom. This dual-paddling system was previously unseen in other Arkanoid-clones.[CR]Kirby's Block ball also has a few other never before seen features for the genre. In addition to the dual-paddling system, players can also use a well-timed and placed button press to turn the ball into KIrby which would enable them to destroy certain bricks. Some bricks require users to utilize this tactic to destroy them. Also in levels 1-3, instead of an empty void for the ball to fall into, there isa spike floor. If a normal, non-Kirby-form ball hits the spikes, the player loses a life. However, if players hit the spikes while the ball is in Kirby form, it will bounce harmlessly off the spikes with no penalization. This would prove to be a strategy in that players would constantly and consistently try to create the Kirby-form version of the ball to avoid losing lives when hitting the spikes. The first three levels also feature enemies for the player to hit. Upon hitting the enemies, they turn into tasty treats for the player to collect to add to their point total.[CR]Levels 4-5 is slightly different than the previous 3 in a few ways. First off, level fours no longer have the player controlling two paddles. The top paddle is non-existent, forcing the player to only use the bottom paddle to launch and deflect the ball. Also, instead of normal bricks to destroy, every level 4 in each world has star bricks. If players can destroy every single star brick and destroy the enemy pacing on top of the level, they are treated to an extra life. The enemy pacing on top of the level is a miniature version of the upcoming boss players will face in the fifth and final level of the different worlds.[CR]The fifth level in world is a boss fight. Players fight an enlarged version of the enemy they defeated in level four. Level five also differs from the previous four levels in two unique ways. One, players no longer have one or two paddles. Instead, players are required to control four paddles, one on each side of the screen. Each paddle moves in unison according to the opposite paddle. Hitting up or down would move both left and right-side paddles up and down, etc. Each side of the level also has spiked floors, which are covered by a layer of star blocks.[CR]Each boss in each world is unique and each possess their own tactic for defense. For example, in world two the boss is a squid. After being hit a certain amount of times the squid catches any balls directed at its frontside and hurl it back at the player. Other bosses may paralyze the paddles, or shrink them by 75%.[CR]Upon finishing each world, players either receive a flag or a star icon on the defeated world. A flag symbolizes that the player now owns the high score for the world while a star icon simply recognizes the player managed to beat that specific world.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1996</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>VXclo0eSimE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2305</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585777-kirbys-block-ball</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/kirbys-block-ball</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kirbys-block-ball/3030-19344/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2305-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2305-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55388-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172264-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/179801-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/212435-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162693-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162694-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-game-map.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162695-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-round-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162696-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-round-clear.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162697-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-round-2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162698-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-bonus-round.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/162699-kirby-s-block-ball-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-super.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6182/2243723-kbb3.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6182/2243722-kbb2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6182/2243721-kbb4.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2305-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Kirby's Dream Land (USA, Europe)">		<description>Kirby's Dream Land (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="40F25740" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKirby%27s%20Dream%20Land%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="90979BAA1D0E24B41B5C304C5DDAF77450692D5A" size="136759" />		<title_clean>Kirby's Dream Land</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kirby's Dream Land is a side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL Laboratory and originally published by Nintendo in 1992 for Game Boy. The first entry in a long-running series, it is a simple platformer starring Kirby, a puffball-like character with the ability to inhale objects such as enemies and spit them out as projectiles. The game's plot involves King Dedede, a large penguin and the self-proclaimed king of Dream Land, who has recently stolen all of Dream Land's food. It's up to Kirby to confront Dedede and his minions in order to retrieve the stolen food before Dream Land's inhabitants starve.[CR]Kirby's Dream Land was conceived by HAL developer  Masahiro Sakurai. The protagonist's simple design was first used as a placeholder sprite by the development team, who intended to eventually replace the character with a more complex design. Originally named "Popopo" (the game's working title was Twinkle Popo), his name was eventually changed to "Kirby" in reference to a brand of vacuum cleaners. Kirby's Dream Land also contains references to HAL's preceding Adventures of Lolo series, most notably the second stage boss fight against Lololo and Lalala.[CR]The game was digitally re-released for the Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console in 2011. It was also re-released for Wii as part of the Kirby's Dream Collection compilation, and a timed demo version was used for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Although the game never received a standalone release for home consoles, it did receive a pseudo-remake as Spring Breeze, the first of seven main game modes featured in Kirby Super Star for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A more difficult version of Spring Breeze known as Revenge of the King was also included in Kirby Super Star Ultra, the Nintendo DS remake of Kirby Super Star.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a fairly traditional platformer, Kirby's Dream Land follows the titular character's quest to save Dream Land across five stages. Kirby has the ability to suck in enemies and then shoot them out as a projectile. Pressing Down on the directional pad will make Kirby duck; if he has something in his mouth, this makes Kirby swallow the object to dispose of it. Pressing Up causes Kirby to inflate with air, allowing him to fly through the air indefinitely. If Kirby exhales afterward, he expels an puff of air which can be used as a weaker projectile. While floating or holding an object in his mouth, Kirby is slower and becomes an easier target for enemy attacks.[CR]Kirby can eat certain food items to restore his six health points; touching or inhaling the food will instantly restore some of his health. Kirby's Dream Land contains two healing items: "Pep Brew", a beverage which heals two points of health, and the "Bag of Magic Food" (later known as a Maxim Tomato), which fully restores Kirby's health. There are also a variety of power-ups that Kirby can collect throughout the game to gain special abilities or attacks:Bomb: Kirby can toss this item at enemies to create a large explosion, which can also damage Kirby if he's too close to the blast.Spicy Food (aka Superspicy Curry): Kirby breathes damaging fire for several seconds. Contact with water will negate Spicy Food's effects.Microphone: Kirby will screech into a microphone, destroying all enemies on the screen.Candy: A magic lollipop granting Kirby temporary invincibility.Mint Leaf: Grants Kirby the ability to rapid-fire "air pellets" from his mouth while flying. Only found in the game's third stage.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Each of the five stages consist of a branching pathway to the boss room, where Kirby fights a large enemy before collecting the Sparkling Star, which transports him to the next stage. Most levels also contain sub-bosses, who must also be defeated in order to progress. The fifth level is the only unconventional one, as it is merely a tower where Kirby is required to fight through a boss rush of Dream Land's previous four bosses before reaching the final boss, King Dedede.Green Greens - Whispy WoodsCastle Lololo - Lololo and LalalaFloat Islands - KaboolaBubbly Clouds - KrackoMt. Dedede - King Dedede[CR]After defeating King Dedede, players are given a code to access the game's "Extra Mode", a more difficult version of Kirby's Dream Land. From the title screen, press Up, A and Select simultaneously to enable Extra Mode. This code can be entered from Dream Land's title screen regardless of whether the game has actually been completed or not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Title Screen codes.[CR]On the title screen....[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Chameleon kirby[CR]Right after the miniboss in Bubbly Clouds, Kirby will fall down a waterfall. Beside it there is a mint - if you swallow the mint while falling in the waterfall you will blend into the background. If you touch the water the glitch will be canceled. Also keep in mind that you aren't invincible, - you're just like normal except you are inside the background. The effect wears off once you move to the next room.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Screen Saver[CR]Any time during the game pause the screen and wait a few seconds.

For Kirby, each ally gives him bonus maneuverability on certain environments (ground for Rick, air for Coo, and water for Kine), allows him to inhale at places where he couldn't (in the air for Coo, in the water for Kine), and alters his abilities (for example, using Spark while riding Rick changes it to the Beam attack from Kirby's Adventure).Set in Dream Land, the story involves a mysterious and evil force called Dark Matter, who has possessed King Dedede and has destroyed the Rainbow Bridges (connecting the seven Rainbow Islands) with the intent of conquering Dream Land. It's up to Kirby and his three animal friends to restore peace to the Rainbow Islands.Kirby's Dream Land 2 also features Super Game Boy support, using the power of the SNES to add enhanced color palettes (adding separate color schemes for the background, status bar, etc.), a unique game border (showing Kirby and his three animal friends), and some special sound effects. The enhanced color palette support is also used when played with the Game Boy Color. Initially, an enhanced color re-release of the game was planned for the Game Boy Color (akin to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX), but was cancelled.The game was later digitally re-released for the Nintendo 3DS (via Virtual Console) on February 15, 2012 (in Japan), May 17, 2012 (in Europe), and August 1, 2013 (in North America) and was included in the Kirby's Dream Collection compilation for the Wii.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Kirby's Dream Land 2 expands on that of the original Kirby's Dream Land, as well as Kirby's Adventure. For the most part, the game is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The goal in each level is to reach the final door, by traversing throughout a (sometimes mazelike) level, defeating enemies, gathering items, and dodging obstacles. Kirby must collect the seven Rainbow Drops to save Dram Land.Kirby has six health points. Each hit takes away one of these points, which can be replenished by picking up a variety of items, such as the well-known Maxim Tomato. Kirby's other abilities include an indefinite jump (by inhaling air and flying upward), exhalation as an attack (even when Kirby doesn't posses an enemy's ability), as well as swimming and regular jumping.The key new feature of Kirby's Dream Land 2 is the addition of several animal friends to assist Kirby. There are three allies in Dream Land 2: Rick the Hamster, Kine the Ocean Sunfish, and Coo the Owl. Each specializes in a different mode of travel, which are (respectively) ground, sea, and air. Kirby is still able to use enemy's abilities while riding these creatures, but they may sometimes be modified. It also gives Kirby higher power in terms of speed, attack, and health points.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There is a total of seven separate worlds Kirby must travel through.Level 1 - Grass LandLevel 2 - Big ForestLevel 3 - Ripple FieldLevel 4 - IcebergLevel 5 - Red CanyonLevel 6 - Cloudy ParkLevel 7 - Dark CastleRainbow DropsTo achieve the true ending and face a final confrontation with the Dark Matter, Kirby must locate seven Rainbow Drops (each located on their own Rainbow Island), which then forms into a Rainbow Sword. Each Rainbow Drop is hidden in a way that requires clever use of his copy abilities.[CR][B]Abilities:[/B][CR] One of Kirby's many abilities.This is a list of the available copy abilities in Kirby's Dream Land 2.Cutter - Kirby throws a sharp blade like a boomerang.Burning - Kirby turns into a fireball.Ice - Kirby breathes a freezing breath.Parasol - Kirby swings a parasol like a sword.Spark - Kirby stands still and shoots sparks around himself.Needle - Kirby sprouts needles like a porcupine.Stone - Kirby transforms into an invincible boulder. If used in the air, Kirby will fall on his enemies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Option Mode[CR]Once you complete the game 100%, go back to load up your file. It will come up with two choices-Start and option. In option Mode you have access to a sound test, a boss battle game or a bonus game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain an extra life every enemy you destroy[CR]Once you have 9999990 points every time you destroy an enemy or earn any more points in any way you will get 1 extra life.</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.1</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>EI4QuYRtAbs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3190</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563276-kirbys-dream-land-2</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/kirbys-dream-land-2</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kirbys-dream-land-2/3030-4474/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/11833</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3190-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3190-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/99101-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57538-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64734-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21564-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21565-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-big-forest.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21566-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-swimming-with-kine.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21567-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-super-game-boy-enhancements.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21568-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-take-flight-with-coo.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611766-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-explore-first-world.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611767-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-swallow-star-with.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611768-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-rainy-song.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611769-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-hit-umbrella.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611770-kirby-s-dream-land-2-game-boy-screenshot-clouds.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3190-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3190-2.jpg</fanart2>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/kfQCz7b.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Kirby's Pinball Land (USA, Europe)">		<description>Kirby's Pinball Land (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="31CB6526" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKirby%27s%20Pinball%20Land%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="06EFDB138FF56CD9522DECE44ADADD3FAE169C76" size="121990" />		<title_clean>Kirby's Pinball Land</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Boss fights, pinball-style.[CR]Kirby's Pinball Land is a pinball game starring  Kirby and many familiar characters from the Kirby series. The object of the game is to take Kirby to the top of three separate pinball tables themed after a stage from  Kirby's Dream Land. Each table has three individual floors. The only way to lose a life is to fall through the bottom of the third floor and fail to return by bouncing off of the springboard located underneath each table. By reaching the top of the table and finding a warp star Kirby will be taken to a fight against that table's boss. There are three different bosses: Whispy Woods The Poppy Bros. Kracko[CR]Once Kirby has defeated all of them he will be taken to a fight against  King Dedede. Defeating him will start the game over again, allowing Kirby to return to each of the three tables once more and build up an even higher score.ScoringThere are no rain delays in pinball.[CR]Kirby earns points by coming into contact with just about anything on the game boards. Defeating enemies, attacking boss characters, and collecting items will all bestow differing amounts of points on him. In addition to the basic ways of earning points, Kirby also banks a bonus score in the lower right corner. This bonus score consists of a multiplicand and a multiplier. Performing specific actions, especially during mini-games, increases either the multiplicand or the multiplier, with the multiplier being more difficult to increase. When Kirby dies, the product of these two numbers is applied to his total score.[CR]High scores are not kept for each individual table. Instead they are kept for the total score of each playthrough.Mini-Games[CR]There are three different mini-games, one for each table. The mini-games can all be reached by locating a warp star on the second floor. In these games Kirby can score bonus points and even earn 1-Ups. Each has a different objective. The Whispy Woods game revolves around breaking blocks to earn bonuses. The Poppy Bros. game involves shooting Kirby into a soccer goal guarded by  Squishy. Finally, the Kracko mini-game requires you to knock items passing by up to a second Kirby who is standing over the playing area awaiting a meal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonuses[CR]At the title screen...</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.1</rating>		<videoid>zwrw-k74TOU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3191</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585778-kirbys-pinball-land</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/kirbys-pinball-land</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kirbys-pinball-land/3030-14646/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8613</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3191-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3191-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55385-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56855-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/193977-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/118220-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122253-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-the-football-bonus.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122254-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-reach-certain-score.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458728-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458730-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-highscores.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458731-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-selecting-the-table.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458732-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-gameplay.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458733-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-each-table-is-divided.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/458729-kirby-s-pinball-land-game-boy-screenshot-statistics.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6182/2243719-kpbl4.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/9CkRdm4.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Kirby's Star Stacker (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Kirby's Star Stacker (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="91300898" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKirby%27s%20Star%20Stacker%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="3999993D31E457BB279EFAC3E4A65FE4967BA861" size="172142" />		<title_clean>Kirby's Star Stacker</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star-stacker Kirby stacks stars.[CR]Kirby's Star Stacker is a puzzle game where the object is to collect as many stars as possible. To do this, the player must sandwich the stars either vertically or horizontally between two identical friends. These friends are Rick, Kine, and Coo, Kirby's buddies from the "Dream Land" series. Objects fall from the sky in pairs of two. If the pile of friends and stars reaches the top of the gameplay area, the game is over. King DeDeDe's head sits on the right hand side of the screen. DeDeDe is there to make sure that Kirby makes as little progress as possible, and if he doesn't like what he sees, his head will turn into a fist. When this fist pounds down and shakes the screen, the level of blocks on the playing area will increase. Like in Tetris, if the blocks on the playing field reach to the top of the screen and no more can fit onto it without being pushed off the top, then the game will be over.Chains[CR]Creating a chain reaction will cause stars to fall from the sky. In other words, if deleting one pair of blocks causes another pair of blocks to be deleted, then more star blocks will fall from the top of the playing field and potentially create even more chain reactions, which will in turn cause even greater numbers of stars to drop onto the playing field. These star blocks always count towards your total score, and will always instantly disappear if they don't cause a reaction, preventing them from messing up the field.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Round Clear - Clear a certain number of stars to proceed to the next round.[CR]Challenge - The game's endless mode, clear as many stars as possible before you lose.[CR]Time Attack - Clear as many stars as possible in exactly three minutes.[CR]Vs. -

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Make tiles appear on your paddle[CR]In the Japanese version of Klax you can press Select during game play to make a tile appear on your paddle.  It is always the same type of tile and you can do this an infinite amount of times to clear screens quicker.

With sharpened blades and a lethal stick, you slash into a rink surrounded by thousands of screaming fans. It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - 'He shoots, he scores!'[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]On the title screen, push Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, B, A, Start.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous, Arcade</genre>		<studio>Konami</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<videoid>xQ9HVfBDWqc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18308</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585634-blades-of-steel</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/blades-of-steel/3030-6109/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18308-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/2/4/21824_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2788309-konamiice001.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2788308-konami+ice+hockey+%281988%29%28konami%29_004.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2788306-konami+ice+hockey+%281988%29%28konami%29_002.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2788305-konami+ice+hockey+%281988%29%28konami%29_001.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283502-warminup.gif</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283501-title.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283500-skiing.gif</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283499-shootin.gif</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283498-score.gif</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/110964/2283497-offyougo.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Konamic Sports in Barcelona (Japan)">		<description>Konamic Sports in Barcelona (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="5721E7D6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FKonamic%20Sports%20in%20Barcelona%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="4D3B7D1A615C6783E741812A1B1DE4467ED14EEF" size="93221" />		<title_clean>Konamic Sports in Barcelona</title_clean>		<plot>This ain't no 20-minute workout.

Apart from fighting the bad guys, there are also a few levels that feature Jump'N Run elements.

In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.[CR]The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.[CR]When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.[CR]Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.[CR]Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Titus France SA</studio>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21596</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585784-lamborghini-american-challenge</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/lamborghini-american-challenge</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/crazy-cars-iii/3030-2074/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21596-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116432-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116428-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116429-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-choosing.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116430-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-race-map.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116431-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-race-profile.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116433-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-gambling.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643410-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-rival-joe.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643411-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-road-in.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643412-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-traffic.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/643413-lamborghini-american-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-triangle.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Last Action Hero (USA, Europe)">		<description>Last Action Hero (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="10499AF6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FLast%20Action%20Hero%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="010EB2CBAB987EC242CD0792C789A07C00106F48" size="74999" />		<title_clean>Last Action Hero</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Last Action Hero is a brawler that follows the plot of  Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie, released in the summer of 1993. The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages. Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks. The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.[CR]The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:The Bits Studios release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like Vigilante) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.The Teeny Weeny Games release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like Double Dragon. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.[CR]Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as "one of the worst SNES games ever made." A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on Hardcore Gaming 101.[CR] [CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Sony Imagesoft</studio>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<videoid>8ZYMzb8PAiM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>9366</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585785-last-action-hero</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/last-action-hero</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/last-action-hero/3030-5717/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9366-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9366-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200731-last-action-hero-dos-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72686-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319809-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-intro-for-jack-slater-iv.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43876-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-drive-yourself-into-an-armored.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319810-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-it-is-quite-possible-to-run.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319811-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-blowing-up-an-enemy-truck.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43877-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-a-cutscene-from-the-movie.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43878-last-action-hero-dos-screenshot-arnold-gets-the-girl.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2660924-last+actionhero0003.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2660923-last+action+hero+%28u%29_00000.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2660910-lastactionhero001.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Lawnmower Man, The (Europe)">		<description>Lawnmower Man, The (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="134F91D7" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FLawnmower%20Man%2C%20The%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="6E63A725FC802966986E6ED6917A7B976794F403" size="71023" />		<title_clean>Lawnmower Man, The</title_clean>		<plot>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. [CR]With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.[CR]While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. [CR]The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Time Warner

In the game the player takes on the role of the legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon series of the same name which is in turn based on the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant must lead Arthur's armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or defeat all his armies.[CR]A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows whether units or castles are present in a tile. Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan controls it.[CR]Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This happens in a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters can attack and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items can be collected and the player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by the enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any time by moving through them again. If two enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI opponent. This is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated. [CR]It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups that for example make the player faster or restore health points.The player can return to a castle at any time to heal completely.[CR]The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game's length. Additionally he or she and change the difficulty of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself.

Produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Takashi Tezuka, Link's Awakening was released in Japan in June 1993 and in North America two months later. Link's Awakening garnered positive reviews and set the way for future handheld versions for the series. A DX version was released for the Game Boy Color in 1998.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]At the start of Link's Awakening, Link is washed ashore Koholint Island after a storm at sea. He is rescued by Marin and her father, Tarin, and is brought back to Mabe Village. Soon after, Link is visited by an owl who gives him the quest of gathering the eight instruments of the Sirens and awakening the Wind Fish who is sleeping inside of a giant egg in the mountains. Link, the ever silent protagonist, continues on to visit a mountain range, a forest, plains, a castle, a swamp, the beach, the desert, and many dungeons to complete his task. Link's Awakening is unusual in the Legend of Zelda universe in that it does not involve Hyrule, Ganon, or the Triforce at all. Princess Zelda only receives a single passing mention.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Title ScreenLink's Awakening is a traditional top-down Legend of Zelda title. Link traverses the overworld of Koholint Island venturing into eight dungeons, gathering an item within each that is then often used to defeat the dungeon boss. After the boss has been defeated, Link acquires an Instrument of the Sirens. In between dungeons, minor tasks are preformed to help collect a key to the next dungeon.Link's Awakening introduced many significant elements that have become mainstays of the Zelda series. It was the first game in the series which required the player to press a button to raise their shield. It also allowed players to equip two items, neither of which had to be the sword or shield, creating puzzles where the player had to combine the abilities of two items, e.g. using the Roc's Feather while sprinting with the Pegasus Boots to jump further. It also introduced the series first trading sequence, fishing side quest and set of well hidden collectable items that can be redeemed at a specific location for rewards. It was the first game to give each dungeon its own specific background theme instead of a single generic dungeon theme. It was the first appearance of an ocarina in the Zelda series (the GBA version of A Link to the Past would later rename the flute to ocarina). Although not the first time a musical instrument was featured in a Zelda game, it was the first time multiple songs could be played on said instrument.There are many references to the Mario series in the game. In the side-scrolling levels Goombas and Piranha Plants can be found and in the main village there is a Chain Chomp. The trading quest begins with a Yoshi doll and one of the items that makes up the the long chain of trades is a picture of Princess Peach. Tarin and the Cucco Keeper resemble Mario &amp; Luigi respectively, Mamu resembles Wart while Mr. Write resembles Dr. Wright from the SNES version of SimCity and Richard is from For the Frog the Bell Tolls (hence the frogs in his villa). Tarin's transformation into a raccoon could also be a reference to the tanooki suit from Super Mario Bros 3.There are also many enemies that can be found in dungeons and the overworld that are from Mario games.DungeonsTail CaveBottle GrottoKey CavernAngler's TunnelCatfish's MawFace ShrineEagle's TowerTurtle RockItemsShieldSwordSleepy MushroomMagic PowderRoc's FeatherPower BraceletShovelBombsPegasus BootsOcarinaFlippersBow &amp; ArrowMirror ShieldMagic RodMagnifying LensBoomerangSeashell Sword[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Director Takashi Tezuka has said that the unusual and often self-aware nature of Link's Awakening was directly inspired by the television show Twin Peaks.One of the puzzles in the second dungeon involves a clue on the wall, describing the order in which to kill the rooms enemies.

If the player returns to the shop afterward, the shopkeeper will kill the player.If the player waits for two minutes and thirty seconds in Richard's Villa, the music will change to Totaka's Song.If the player inputs "ZELDA" as the save file name, a remixed theme will play in the background of the save select screen.Unlike the other Zelda games, none of the levels are referred to as dungeons or temples.The maximum number of hearts is 14 instead of the usual 20.The layout of all of the dungeon maps, except Eagle's Tower, form a picture of an object, such as a bottle for Bottle Grotto or a key in Key Cavern.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.1</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>YY4MuqGhVUo</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3193</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563277-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening/3030-3645/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10145</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2267401-zla.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/ExNEsZo.png</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/49P6qnE.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/37308-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69694-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111066-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172519-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172719-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183242-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart9>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23084-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-opening.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23085-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23086-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23087-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23088-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23089-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-visit.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23090-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23091-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-inside.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23092-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-underground.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23093-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-game-boy-screenshot-first.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3193-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3193-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3193-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3193-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3193-5.jpg</fanart5>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/6o2kJRY.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Lemmings (USA)">		<description>Lemmings (USA)</description>		<rom crc="F2D1C19D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FLemmings%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="1754FDE0B1C40752A5716A291E842E38401BAF08" size="111401" />		<title_clean>Lemmings</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]These are for levels 21-25.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords to skip ahead to the desired level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords to skip ahead to the desired level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords to skip ahead to the desired level.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1994</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Ocean of America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>17774</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585787-lemmings</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/lemmings</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/lemmings/3030-1446/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5243</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17774-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57540-lemmings-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57541-lemmings-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/183245-lemmings-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199472-lemmings-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21326-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21327-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21329-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-just-dig.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21330-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-floaters.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21331-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-blockers.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21332-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-miner.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21333-lemmings-game-boy-screenshot-climbers.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2689996-lemmings001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/147156/2674580-amigalemvictory.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2549665-lemmings+%28j%29005.png</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (Europe)">		<description>Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="9800BD49" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FLemmings%202%20-%20The%20Tribes%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="76CCF9AC82FAEBC7F9C4A4C8B5CD47DDEA46C486" size="239022" />		<title_clean>Lemmings 2 - The Tribes</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lemmings 2: Tribes is the sequel to DMA Design's earlier puzzle hit Lemmings and takes its name from the 12 tribes of lemmings that inhabit the island on which the game takes place. The island is divided into twelve regions, one for each tribe. Some tribes differ in color, but all are controlled in the same way. Some abilities are specific to certain tribes, while others are reused several times.[CR]The land of each tribe has its own visual style and music, and some unique challenges.[CR]Psygnosis published the game in the US and Europe. SunSoft would produce the Japanese console versions, as they had with Lemmings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Land of the Lemmings[CR]The game features 120 levels split equally between the 12 tribes. When the 10 levels of any tribe are complete, a segment of a talisman is awarded. When all 12 pieces of talisman are united, the island of the lemmings will be saved.[CR]Over 50 types of lemming are featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.[CR]Each Tribe starts with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.[CR]Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker[CR]*returning from the original Lemmings.

The cover art is taken from the movie poster for Lethal Weapon 3. The game includes elements from the movie (such as the antagonist Jack Travis and Joe Pesci's returning comic relief character Leo Getz) but doesn't closely follow the plot.NES and Game Boy Version[CR]This version is a side-scroller brawler/shooter in which the player assumes either Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson's character) or Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover's character) and fights through hordes of criminals with their guns and fists. The player can also throw grenades should they find any, which can clear out small groups of enemies at once.Super Nintendo Version[CR]In this platformer, the player controls either both Riggs and Murtaugh - Riggs fires faster and Murtaugh jumps higher (presumably no offense was meant) - and plays through five missions set in different locations. The fifth and final stage has the duo arrest Jack Travis and recover the stolen weapons around which the movie focuses.[CR]Test edit. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Title Screen.

Each character has it's own specific level, along with it's own abilities and attacks. Players have three hearts for health, but these hearts can be healed by potions scattered throughout the levels. Somewhere along the level, players fight a mid-level boss, sometimes twice. At the end of each level, a boss fight occurs, and some sort of prize drops down from the air for you to collect and end the level. After the prize is collected, a bonus level pops up. You can collect gems in this level to get 1ups. This is very helpful, because the game has no save feature.Controls Looney Tunes uses a very familiar platformer control scheme. The A button is used to jump, the B button is used to attack, and the D-Pad is used to move your character.  [CR]Level Rundown[CR] Level 1: Daffy Duck Daffy Duck's level starts out on land, where he can use his frisbee attack (I'm sorry, but since when did Daffy Duck have a frisbee?) to kill the various crows and lizards.  It then transitions to a water zone, where Daffy must swim through the level, killing fish and shelled creatures to finally reach the boss: A giant fish. Character: Daffy DuckWeapon/Attack: FrisbeeEnemies: Fish, Shelled creatures, lizards, chickens, crowsMidboss(es): Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Underwater Yosemite SamBoss: Giant FishLevel 2: Tweety Bird Tweety's level is a chase scene, where he is trying to fly away from Sylvester as fast as possible. Chester will jump and run after you, but he can also fall into sewer holes throughout the level, where he will disappear for a while. Tweety can be slowed down by flying plants, baseballs, baseball bats, and mirrors, though he can sometimes be actually sped up by these.  Character: Tweety BirdWeapon/Attack: NoneEnemies: Flying pots, mirrors, baseball bats, plants and baseballsMidboss(es): Sylvester's sonBoss: Sylvester the CatLevel 3: Porky Pig In this level, you control Porky Pig as he flies a plane through a sunset sky.

You will have to avoid spikes and make tricky jumps, as well as outrun the lava that appears about halfway through the level.  There is also a short puzzle sequence, in which you will have to move blocks in the right order to get through and avoid getting crushed.Character: Speedy GonzalezWeapon/Attack: Dancing and causing damaging stars to appear around his bodyEnemies: Bats, frogs, mummies, flying arrows.Midboss(es): Master Frog, Singing MummyBoss: Vampire Bat FormLevel 6: Road Runner Road Runner's level plays a bit like a side scrolling shooter. You do not control his movement as far as distance goes, but you do control his movement from right to left in wherever you are in the level. The level has two parts. In the first part, you must jump on top of rocks to avoid getting hit by them. Second, you fight Wile E. Coyote, who is skiing through the desert with a rocket on his back. You must jump on him while dodging his attacks. Character: Road RunnerWeapon/Attack: JumpingEnemies: RocksMidboss(es): NoneBoss: Wile E.

Each character has it's own specific level, along with it's own abilities and attacks. Players have three hearts for health, but these hearts can be healed by potions scattered throughout the levels. Somewhere along the level, players fight a mid-level boss, sometimes twice. At the end of each level, a boss fight occurs, and some sort of prize drops down from the air for you to collect and end the level. After the prize is collected, a bonus level pops up. You can collect gems in this level to get 1ups. This is very helpful, because the game has no save feature.Controls Looney Tunes uses a very familiar platformer control scheme. The A button is used to jump, the B button is used to attack, and the D-Pad is used to move your character.  [CR]Level Rundown[CR] Level 1: Daffy Duck Daffy Duck's level starts out on land, where he can use his frisbee attack (I'm sorry, but since when did Daffy Duck have a frisbee?) to kill the various crows and lizards.  It then transitions to a water zone, where Daffy must swim through the level, killing fish and shelled creatures to finally reach the boss: A giant fish. Character: Daffy DuckWeapon/Attack: FrisbeeEnemies: Fish, Shelled creatures, lizards, chickens, crowsMidboss(es): Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Underwater Yosemite SamBoss: Giant FishLevel 2: Tweety Bird Tweety's level is a chase scene, where he is trying to fly away from Sylvester as fast as possible. Chester will jump and run after you, but he can also fall into sewer holes throughout the level, where he will disappear for a while. Tweety can be slowed down by flying plants, baseballs, baseball bats, and mirrors, though he can sometimes be actually sped up by these.  Character: Tweety BirdWeapon/Attack: NoneEnemies: Flying pots, mirrors, baseball bats, plants and baseballsMidboss(es): Sylvester's sonBoss: Sylvester the CatLevel 3: Porky Pig In this level, you control Porky Pig as he flies a plane through a sunset sky.

Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.[CR]Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.[CR]Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. [CR]Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.[CR]The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Type C level passwords[CR]Choose Game Type C to enter password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Type B Bonus Levels[CR]If you make a loop and clear the entire board, you will be taken to a bonus level. When you make a loop in this level, it does not clear from the board. You continue playing until you cannot place a piece.Also, if you score enough points in one single loop, you get a second bonus level. The game will randomly choose a puzzle from Game Type C for you to complete, and you only have one chance to complete it.

In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.[CR]Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.[CR]Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.[CR]Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip Levels[CR]At the title screen enter Down,Up,Down,Up,Left,Right,Left,Right and start

/>		<title_clean>Lunar Lander</title_clean>		<plot>Lunar Lander is a space exploration game based around three separate stages:[CR]Lift-off: Fly your space shuttle into outer space by following the guidance arrows displayed on the screen. If you don't centre the shuttle according to the signs, your progress is slowed down and you will run out of fuel before leaving Earth's gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your compressor, since it must be constantly at a high level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for the lift-off to be successful.[CR]Landing: This stage is very similar to the old Lunar Lander type of game that was popular in the early eighties. From a map of the moon, you select one of eight landing sites. On the landing screen, you must carefully guide your lander through the cave-like craters to the landing pads. Different landing pads are worth different amounts of points, according to level of difficulty. Preserving your lander's fuel will also give bonus points. Unlike most typical Lander games, your craft has no rockets for going left or right  instead you must rotate your lander and ignite the single landing rocket in order to adjust your angle. There are also meteorites to watch out for.[CR]Exploration: Once you have landed, an astronaut steps out on the surface, armed with a metal detector. Your task here is to find five different kinds of metal ore and bring them to the lander before you run out of air or time. The metal detector beeps with different frequencies according to your vicinity to a piece of metal. If there is a constant beep, you drill for the metal. If you drill elsewhere, you may find flowers that replenish your air supply. To complicate things, the moon surface is filled with robots that try to hunt you down. Contact with a robot wears down your air supply. [CR]After you have landed and explored all eight areas, your mission is completed and you proceed to the next one, which is more of the same.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Mission Passwords[CR]After entering the password, press Select to activate it.</plot>		<releasedate>21/9/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Pack-In-Video Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575130-lunar-lander</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/lunar-lander</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/8/3/309183_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/8/3/309183_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298029-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298032-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-from-the-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298035-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-ready-for-launch.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298036-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-sr-booster-set.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298038-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-countdown.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298039-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-lift-off.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298040-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-follow-the-guiding-arrows.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298043-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-ran-out-of-fuel.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298044-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-finally-we-left-gravity.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298045-lunar-lander-game-boy-screenshot-you-leave-earth-for-the-moon.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mach Go Go Go (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Mach Go Go Go (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="016D230B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMach%20Go%20Go%20Go%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="BAEA8B49CE2402C5C094DDAE0320A382C0D95D86" size="158137" />		<title_clean>Mach Go Go Go</title_clean>		<plot>Mach Go Go Go is a Driving game, developed by TOSE and published by Tomy Corporation,which was released in Japan in 1997.</plot>		<releasedate>8/8/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Arcade</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569987-mach-go-go-go</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/3/6/306436_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/5/7/gfs_9075_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/8/7/gfs_9075_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/3/7/gfs_9075_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/2/7/gfs_9075_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/9/7/gfs_9075_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/4/7/gfs_9075_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/f/7/gfs_9075_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/2/6/gfs_9075_1_8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/c/a/gfs_9075_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/1/a/gfs_9075_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Madden '95 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Madden '95 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="D2585BBB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMadden%20%2795%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="B41A14394BBD890E341BF5D27F297CB5E906FD60" size="323495" />		<title_clean>Madden '95</title_clean>		<plot>John Madden's back in the 1995 version of Madden NFL.[CR]Play exhibition, Super Bowl, playoffs or full season with any of the 1994 teams or all Madden teams.[CR]This time around, you can select whether or not to include weather conditions, new player animations (high steppin', QB slides), a bigger field and over 100 injuries.[CR]Also includes windowless passing, all new Madden-designed strategies and team match-up that shows how your players stack up to the other team in their position.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/madden-nfl-95[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easily block punts[CR]When the computer is forced to punt, select the "Punt Rush" formation, then take control of your fastest player and line him up on the left side of the field, just outside the leftmost offensive lineman.

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness is well known for it's soundtrack and was the first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. This was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allowed arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You think you can get the marble through this course? Madness!Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (helpfully marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carried momentum and a rudimentary physics model provided most of the challenge, as it was easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism.The marble can be destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning the player's marble near by. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wasted valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that made it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player lost more than one or two marbles.As the game goes on, enemies and obstacles are introduced to the player to make course completion more difficult. The player will run into challenges like moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill.Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Score[CR]At the end of level 1, jump the chasm on the rig, and roll towards the end. If you do it right, jump off the platform leading to the goal. If done right the level will end, and the score will keep on going. You will have to restart to play again though.</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Mindscape</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<videoid>ORhbr--1eyU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21667</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/915981-marble-madness</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/marble-madness</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/marble-madness/3030-9566/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5264</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21667-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/226285-marble-madness-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200040-marble-madness-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/226801-marble-madness-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23979-marble-madness-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23980-marble-madness-game-boy-screenshot-first-race.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23981-marble-madness-game-boy-screenshot-second-race.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23982-marble-madness-game-boy-screenshot-ride-the-wave.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23983-marble-madness-game-boy-screenshot-those-vacuums-sure-do-suck.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/351403-9.gif</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/351402-8.gif</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/351401-7.gif</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/351399-6.gif</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/351398-5.gif</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mario &amp; Yoshi (Europe)">		<description>Mario &amp; Yoshi (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="4627D88B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMario%20%26%20Yoshi%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="9BF642EABDB51625D1EF1AC470666EC8F5F10F77" size="34020" />		<title_clean>Mario &amp; Yoshi</title_clean>		<plot>It's raining Goombas, Bloobers, and Boo Buddies!

in Japan as Rockman World) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Game Boy on December 1991.[CR]The first portable entry of the original Mega Man series, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge recycled many elements from the first two titles in the franchise (including bosses, levels, and enemies) and was the first in the franchise to have multiple sets of Robot Masters (as players must fight the first four to proceed to the next four).[CR]The game is set in the year 20XX, sometime after the events of Mega Man 2. Despite being constantly defeated by humanoid robot hero Mega Man, the evil Dr. Wily has returned with eight of his previous Robot Masters (with four tearing up the town and four lurking in his castle). It's up to Mega Man to scrap his robotic foes while facing Dr. Wily and his mysterious new creation.[CR]The game was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS on September 15, 2011.[CR]Levels and Robot Masters:[CR]The First Four Robot Masters[CR]At the start, the player can choose from four different stages, each containing a robot master taken from Mega Man for the NES (Elec Man, Fire Man, Ice Man, and Cut Man). After defeating the four Robot Masters, Mega Man heads to Dr. Wily&#8217;s Fortress stage. At the end of this stage you encounter four additional Robot Masters, taken from Mega Man II for the NES ( Bubble Man, Heat Man, Flash Man, and Quick Man). After defeating these four Robot Masters you take on an original Robot Boss called Enker. Finally, Mega Man travels to Dr. Wily&#8217;s space station stage to take on Dr. Wily himself.[CR]Weapons and Items:[CR]As in most Mega Man games, Mega Man acquires the ability to use the weapons of the Robot Masters that he defeats. This includes the original four Robot Masters, the four additional Robot Masters encountered in Dr. Wily&#8217;s Fortress, and the special boss Enker. The weapons are:The Carry Item[CR]Cut Man: Rolling Cutter &#8211; Shoots a powerful cutter that boomerangs out and then back. Very effective against Elec Man.[CR]Elec Man : Thunder Beam &#8211; Shoots a tall electric beam. Very effective against Ice Man.[CR]Ice Man : Ice Slasher &#8211; Shoots an icy blast that can freeze some enemies. Very effective against Fire Man.[CR]Fire Man : Fire Storm &#8211; Shoots a fire blast towards the enemy and creates a shield of fire that temporarily surrounds Mega Man. Somewhat effective against Cut Man.[CR]Bubble Man : Bubble Lead &#8211; Shoots a bubble which travels along the floor. Very effective against Heat Man.[CR]Heat Man : Atomic Fire &#8211; Shoots a heat blast that can be charged up. Somewhat effective against Quick Man and Flash Man.[CR]Quick Man : Quick Boomerang &#8211; Shoots several small boomerangs which travel out, and then back. Somewhat effective against Bubble Man and Heat Man.[CR]Flash Man : Time Stopper &#8211; Freezes time and damages the enemy.

Unlike the rest of the spin-off series, Mega Man V does not recycle bosses and levels from a set of two consecutive titles in the main franchise. Instead, it features a cast of entirely-new villains (the nine Stardroids, robots from outer space), each with their own level. It is also the only game in the series to feature both the Mega Arm (a new upgradable primary weapon for Mega Man in which charging his arm cannon shoots his fist at enemies, only for it to return to him) and Tango (Mega Man's robotic cat who can be summoned to attack enemies on the screen). Mega Man V was one of the first Game Boy games (prior to Game Boy Color) to directly support the Super Game Boy peripheral for the SNES.[CR]Set in the year 20XX, the game takes place sometime after humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeated Dr. Wily and his fourth group of revived Robot Masters. Mega Man is confronted by a mysterious robot, who calls himself Terra, and is unable to defeat him with his trademark Mega Buster. As he is knocked unconscious, Earth is invaded by groups of powerful robots from space (called "Stardroids"). When he awakens, he finds that Dr. Light has outfitted him with a new weapon that delivers stronger blows to his new adversaries.

Each level starts with a screen where the player can hire up to four of the five mercenary characters (multiples can be chosen) to fight through the level with. The five different mercenaries have differing Yen costs although the more expensive mercenaries are not necessarily stronger than the lower end mercenaries.[CR]The gameplay primarily consists of moving the group of mercenaries around and shooting their various projectiles at the oncoming hordes of enemies. In standard fashion, once the player successfully moves through the level they encounter a boss which ends the level.FormationsThe four formations.[CR]When the player has more than one mercenary under control then they move in a formation that can be changed by the player to help avoid being hit by oncoming projectiles. The default formation has one in front, one in back and one on each side. The second formation features the characters bunching up in a square, the third has two in front with two in the back and the last formation lines up all the mercenaries vertically.Yen &amp; StoresNutritious, nutritious sushi.[CR]Every enemy defeated drops at least one ten Yen coin with a fairly short despawn timer so the player is encouraged to grab the coins as fast as possible. Each level in the game has several stores that the player can walk into and buy various foods to replenish health or an item called a Scripture which will turn the leading mercenary into a monk. Players might also find a store-front that has a luck based game and another building where a man restores health to all mercenaries for free. The Yen that the player has collected is persistent through levels to it can be used to hire mercenaries at the beginning of the next level.SacrificeSuper monk![CR]The first mercenary in the player&#8217;s formation can be sacrificed to transform into a large form that scrolls faster through the level and will destroy any enemies in its path. The downside to the use of the super form is that the character that transforms is killed at the end and the player is left with less mercenaries to fight with. The servant, however, does not have a super form. He explodes and clears the screen of all enemies.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are five nameless mercenaries that can be hired by the player.The five mercenaries.Servant: The servant is the cheapest mercenary costing only &#165;400 to hire. He has 6 HP and uses a rifle to shoot slow, long-range bullets forward. The servant does not have a super form, but he sacrifices himself to clear the screen of all enemies.Samurai: The samurai has 12 HP making him the most durable mercenary. He costs &#165;800 to hire and throws two slow short-range throwing knives forward. His super form is a slow moving oni.Ninja: The ninja is well-rounded with his fast medium-range throwing stars, 10 HP and &#165;1000 price point. The ninja&#8217;s super form is a wind elemental with throwing stars circling him.Monk: The monk has 9 HP and at &#165;1200 he is the most expensive mercenary to hire. His advantage lies in the two diagonal lightning bolts that he shoots. They are slow, but he is the only character that can shoot diagonally.

To prevent such an incident from happening again the Galactic Federation sent teams to the home planet of the Metroid,  SR388, to destroy the species. None of the teams survived, so they sent in bounty hunter Samus Aran to destroy the Metroids.[CR]During the game Samus destroys every Metroid on the planet, discovering and eliminating each of the creature's  different forms.[CR]At the end of the game Samus defeats the final boss, the Queen Metroid. When traveling back to her ship she discovers a Metroid egg which proceeds to hatch in front of her. The floating hatchling decides to mark Samus as it's mother, and Samus spares its life. The hatching Metroid leads Samus out of the tunnels, helping her escape from the planet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays much like the first  Metroid game did. The player must explore whatever part of the planet they currently have access to until they discover whatever they need to proceed further. Usually this involves finding a powerup that will allow them to bypass some obstacle that was previously impassable. However, in this game it is also necessary to destroy every single Metroid within Samus' reach. Doing so will trigger earthquakes which will affect the level of the magma that restricts Samus' progress into the deepest parts of the planet. The Metroids gradually mutate under the unstable planet's radiation and become more dangerous as the game goes on, so arming Samus as much as possible is important.[CR]Progression in this game is fairly more linear as that of the other Metroid games. The game doesn't typically require you to back track. Unlike the first game, you can save at various points in the game.[CR]Graphics[CR]Being on the original  Game Boy the game had a monochrome presentation. The result of such a limited color pallet was added detail to Samus's suit, such as the large shoulder-guards which have since remained a consistent part of her design ever since. Other notable aspects of the presentation are the different sprites for each of the  Metroid's different forms.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stalljump[CR]If you do a directly vertical spinning jump and hold up, Samus stalls in midair. Perfect to use with the screw attack, since most if not all attacks will do absolutely nothing to you during it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Different Ending[CR]Beat the game in under 3 hours, and when Samus shows up in the ending, you'll see her in a bikini</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>AF1C0xZxBOw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>6771</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585799-metroid-ii-return-of-samus</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/metroid-ii-return-of-samus</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6936</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6771-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6771-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/176420-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57410-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/122045-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69862-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111530-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172295-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20441-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20442-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-samus-s-ship.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20443-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-inside-the-sr388.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20444-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-roll-into-tight.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20445-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-destroy-metroids.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20446-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-metroid.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/364322-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-finding-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/364323-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-a-large-plant.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/364324-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-defeat-this.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/364325-metroid-ii-return-of-samus-game-boy-screenshot-metroids-become.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6771-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6771-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6771-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6771-4.jpg</fanart4>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/yMlVaXv.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6771.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Mickey Mouse - Magic Wands (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Mickey Mouse - Magic Wands (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="F0482567" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMickey%20Mouse%20-%20Magic%20Wands%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="90A181EE7D42941BCE3B425077D6570DA0E2FB2C" size="78667" />		<title_clean>Mickey Mouse - Magic Wands</title_clean>		<plot>In this game your quest is to take Mickey Mouse through several dungeons, and mostly avoid your enemies.[CR]The game is somewhat more a puzzle game than a plat-former.

The game does not follow several of the key gameplay elements to franchises such as Super Mario Bros., as enemies cannot be defeated by jumping on them, rather the player must hit the enemy with a thrown item. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mickey Mouse surprises Minnie Mouse with a present. However, Pete, who usually attempts to foil Mickey's plans, successfully steals the present, causing Mickey to chase after Pete. Goofy and Minnie tag along, as Goofy usually tells the player where Pete is headed next, while Minnie offers words of encouragement. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mickey Mouse is game's main character, with players navigating Disney's mascot through a variety of stages, meeting Goofy at the ending of each stage. Picking up square blocks scattered throughout the level, and correctly timing and aiming a throw will cause enemies to fly off the screen accompanied by a zooming sound effect.  [CR]The game also does not rely on heavy use of the Disney brand, as each level is either a generic Town, Woods, or Mountain. Enemies are also generic for the most part, aside from familiar styled pit bulls and weasels. Mickey faces against adversaries that are themed with the current level, as spiders appear in a haunted mansion, and flying squirrels attack Mickey while in the Woods. [CR]In addition to the platforming levels, Mickey also uses a few vehicles to catch up to Pete, such as a motorboat and an automobile. During these stages, the screen autoscrolls, forcing Mickey to avoid certain obstacles in a limited amount of time, while also successfully navigating the level. Certain birds can also give Mickey a ride, allowing the player to hop from bird to bird in a vertical progression down a mountainside. [CR]Players begin each levels with three hearts in the health meter, allowing for multiple hits before Mickey must restart the level. White heart cards replenish health, while cards displaying the silhouette of Mickey Mouse gain the player extra lives. Each level also has four hidden orbs, and when each is found, Goofy will reward the player with extra lives. [CR]Puzzle elements are found in the Intustrial Zone stages, where blocks must be picked up in a specific order if Mickey is to successfully navigate the floor-spiked warehouse.

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.[CR]Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.[CR]Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.[CR]After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.[CR]Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Hi-Tech Expressions</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21597</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585801-mickeys-ultimate-challenge</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mickeys-ultimate-challenge</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mickeys-ultimate-challenge/3030-8555/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21597-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/6/1/46461_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229027-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229028-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-character.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229029-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-difficulty.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229030-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-intro-cutscene.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229031-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-mickey-awakens.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229032-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-mickey-finds.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229033-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-mickey-s-first.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229034-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-mickey-gains.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229035-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-mickey-finds.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/229036-mickey-s-ultimate-challenge-game-boy-screenshot-as-he-gets.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Micro Machines (USA, Europe)">		<description>Micro Machines (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="2088F85F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMicro%20Machines%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="62C07BAA3ED0CCAF704399F05FE90569D90C6EFF" size="165505" />		<title_clean>Micro Machines</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Micro Machines is a circuit-type racing game with top-down graphics. Players select a character from a vast roster and race against CPU or human opponents; neither the races nor the cars the player finds himself in are related to the character. Each character has a CPU strength rating but there are zero differences between them when played by human players.[CR]Micro Machines is based on the toy line of the same name of very small collectible car models. To suit their miniature form, each course in the game is set in a region of a regular home: the kitchen table, a games room with a pool table, a garden, etc.[CR]Micro Machines was released on almost every console and home computer system available in 1994. It also saw a sequel: Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One Player Mode[CR] Head-to-Head[CR]In this mode there are only two vehicles are in play: one player controlled and one AI. The objective is to gain enough distance between the opponent as to make him stay out of the screen, when this happens the car on screen is awarded a point from the opponent's pool (each player starts with 4 each). These points go back and forth until someone has all eight points or the race ends naturally after three laps.Challenge[CR]This mode places the player in 25 races against three other AI controlled vehicles. The player starts with a set number of lives, and loses them for each race where they don't place in the top two places. Once they run out of lives, they are eliminated. The AI characters are also eliminated and replaced by stronger opponents as they place badly through the races.[CR] Two Player ModeHead-to-Head[CR]This mode is the same as described in the "One Player" section, only both vehicles are human-controlled.[CR] Tournament[CR]In Tournament two players are pitted against each other in the same fashion as Head-to-Head for a series of five races and whoever wins most races out of the five is declared winner.[CR]Vehicles and Environments[CR]The type of vehicles change, and are fixed for each environment:[CR] Bathtub - Powerboats[CR]These are standard powerboats with standard handling. The Bathtub stages are relatively free of course hazards.[CR] [CR] [CR] Breakfast Table - Four by Four[CR]A four-by-four jeep like off-roader that controls well over rough terrain. The breakfast table is filled with food spills that the four-by-four has little trouble with.[CR] [CR] [CR] Desktop - Sportcars[CR]These convertible cars may be small but they do put out a fight with a high top speed and finicky handling. The Desktop environment has a lot of ramps and barricades.[CR] [CR] [CR] Worktop - Warriors[CR]A group of mean looking cars that look like they come right out of Mad Max. Decent handling and speed but are best suited for bumping each other off the course. The worktop is filled with tools and other impassable objects.Billiards Table - Formula One[CR]Formula One (or open-wheel) racecars, like in real life, sport extremely high top speeds on straights and high acceleration without a compromise on the corners. The billiards table naturally has a lot of pool balls and cues to get in the players' way.Sandbox - Turbo Wheels[CR]Dune buggy vehicles designed for the sandy terrain of the sandbox. Obstacles include buckets and spades.Garden - Choppers[CR]The helicopters have tricky turning cycles but are able to fly over all but the tallest obstacles in the garden course. [CR] Bedroom floor - Tanks[CR]Tanks are slow vehicles with poor turning but have the advantage of shooting one's opponent, forcing them to respawn behind the player's location. The goal of these stages is to stay ahead and elude the shots of those behind them.

It was the first Micro Machines game in which cars handles differently on each course and the first title in which helicopters and hovercraft featured. The idea behind this was to add variety to the gameplay but the differences in handling where minimal except for the case of the hovercraft which was very tricky to handle.[CR]J-Cart[CR]The famous J-Cart with extra joypad portsThe main addition Micro Machines 2 brought to the table, and the reason the game carried the Turbo Tournament tag was the J-Cart. The J-Cart was a modified game cartridge that as well as storing the game also housed 2 controller ports. This enabled the Genesis version of the game to now accept four controllers instead of the usual two. As Micro Machines 2 races featured 4 racers at a time the makers then decided that for some reason four players would still not be enough. They added the ability for 2 players to play with the same pad, with one player taking the dpad to steer and the other using the face buttons accelerate/bracke their car. In Practice this was always a very amusing way to play as you had to be certain that your fellow player would screw up at the death.[CR]Vehicles[CR] Rally CarsConstruction JeepsBuggysDragstersConvertablesHelecoptersHovercraftsSports carsThree wheeled bikes[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>0.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>24094</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575133-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament/3030-20350/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24094-1.png</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25212-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25213-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-player.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25214-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-atv-s.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25215-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-sports.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25216-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-beach.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25217-micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament-game-boy-screenshot-monster.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/746181-1134578181_00.gif</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/746180-1134578132_00.gif</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/746179-1134578356_00.gif</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/746178-1134578332_00.gif</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/24094.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Midori no Makibaou (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Midori no Makibaou (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="1DD93D95" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMidori%20no%20Makibaou%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="4DE380B202E375761F9FE7FB13349F5B02E2DAC2" size="102909" />		<title_clean>Midori no Makibaou</title_clean>		<plot>Midori no Makibao is a Driving game, developed by TOSE and published by Tomy Corporation,which was released in Japan in 1996.</plot>		<releasedate>21/12/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Arcade</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569940-midori-no-makibao</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/9/7/306397_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/9/7/306397_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/1/4/gfs_9074_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/c/4/gfs_9074_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/7/4/gfs_9074_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/6/4/gfs_9074_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/d/4/gfs_9074_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/0/4/gfs_9074_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/b/4/gfs_9074_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/6/5/gfs_9074_1_8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/8/9/gfs_9074_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/5/9/gfs_9074_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="C60D032A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="EF88476D9A1A26B67F3535AE7AFCF5156578E38C" size="120671" />		<title_clean>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Based on the popular children's show of the same name, the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed by Natsume and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game allows the player to be any of the five original cast of Power Rangers as they fight through waves of putty patrol and five different monsters created by Rita Repulsa. The game ends climatically with the Power Rangers calling for the Megazord and flying to the moon to battle Rita's overgrown creature in front of her fortress.[CR]While the game's plot doesn't mirror any particular storyline from the live-action series, the game captures many concepts characteristic to the show. Zack is seen dancing during the credits, and incorporates dance moves in his fighting style. Billy, not being a trained martial artist, fights in a cowardly way. Lastly, just like every episode of the show, the game ends with the Power Rangers calling for the Megazord in order to defeat a building-sized monster that Rita grew.[CR]The game is not to be confused with the Genesis fighter of the same name released the same year. While both were released to coincide with the show's run, they both have different genres and were developed by different studios.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]After seeing Rita Repulsa wreaking havoc on Angel Grove, the Power Rangers put it on themselves to protect the city. The rangers fight in a variety of locations, including the city streets and parks, an industrial factory, the sewers, skyscrapers, and a secret underground headquarters. After having the putty patrol and her monsters defeated at the hands of the Power Rangers, Rita resorts to growing one of her minions, named Mutitus. The rangers call for the Megazord, and a giant battle ensues at the shores of Angel Grove. After besting Rita's overgrown creation, the Power Rangers fly to the moon with the Megazord for one last fight against a leviathan called Cyclopsis. Once the rangers have defeated all of Rita's forces, they come back home to a safe Angel Grove. Jason, Zack, Billy, Trini, and Kimberly are seen enjoying their victory with a joyride on the coast of the beach in a convertible.[CR]As the game starts before the Green With Evil arc in the series, Tommy the Green Ranger is not present.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]At the beginning of each level, the player is able to choose any of the five Power Rangers to fight with. The first half of the level consists of the player fighting in civilian form against a variety of putties. Once the level's boss appears to confront the player character, he/she morphs into a Power Ranger. As a Power Ranger, the player gains extra strength, more life, a special 'bomb' attack, and a weapon specific to the character they chose:Jason - SwordZack - AxeBilly - B&#333; / StaffTrini - Dual DaggersKimberly - Bow and Arrow[CR]The later half of the level has the player fighting more enemies until they reach the boss, who must be defeated in order to continue to the next level. The five bosses in the set of on-foot levels were:Level 1: BonesLevel 2: Gnarly GnomeLevel 3: Eye GuyLevel 4: GenieLevel 5: Dark Warrior[CR]The last two levels have the players taking control of the Megazord as they fight a gigantic enemy one-on-one. The last boss having 2 forms. The Megazord is equipped with a power sword and various projectiles. A 'POW' bar increases over time, allowing the player to unleash stronger projectile attacks during the fight. The 'POW' bar depletes after using a projectile, and time must pass before another shot can be fired again.[CR]Game Boy release[CR]The Game Boy version included a Megazord boss battle at the end of each level, and different boss characters, as well as Super Game Boy functionality.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Mode Passwords[CR]To help you get to Levels 2-5.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Mode Passwords[CR]To help you get to Levels 2-5.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Mode Passwords[CR]Enter one of the following passwords to enter the respective stage:</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Bandai America</studio>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<videoid>PPRQJ96sOgE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21671</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585803-mighty-morphin-power-rangers</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mighty-morphin-power-rangers_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers/3030-6531/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21671-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210297-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210298-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444178-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444179-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-character.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444180-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-looks-like.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444181-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-beginning.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444182-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-meeting-our.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444183-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-our-failure.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444184-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2752693-mightymorphin001.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2752692-mighty+morphin+power+rangers+%28u%29_00014.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2752691-mighty+morphin+power+rangers+%28u%29_00013.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="86A1C549" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers%20-%20The%20Movie%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="0646BFF26350059224A5DCA807218FF02A4704AF" size="147512" />		<title_clean>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie</title_clean>		<plot>This game is loosely based off of the movie of the same name, where the player can take control of either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying to control the universe.[CR]There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.[CR]Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.  Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]To reach the bosses, enter the following passwords:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]To view the credits, enter the following code as the password in Option Mode:</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Bandai America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21670</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585804-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie/3030-21927/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21670-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/6/6/46466_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349312-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349313-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349304-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349305-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349306-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349307-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349308-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349310-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349311-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349314-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Migrain (Japan)">		<description>Migrain (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="CED936F8" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMigrain%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="98EA7EAB4048CBD0E4AA5F88E9A831E522C493D5" size="21167" />		<title_clean>Migrain</title_clean>		<plot>Test your prowess as a master of mirrors in one of the world's most exciting new puzzle games, Brain Bender!

Players take control of Milon who is tasked with entering the secret castle to save Princess Eliza. To do so the player must venture through multiple rooms and slowly work up the 4 floors of the castle. The game has a music theme to it as the people are supposed to communicate with musical instruments.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shooting a bubble[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is based on exploring several rooms on each of the 4 floors in the castle and defeating the demon on each floor to advance up. The game is a platformer, but unlike many members of the genre, it's not based on moving from right to left, but explore bite sized rooms of a large castle. Milon, the main character, explores each of the many rooms, collecting money and other items, attmepting to find the key and exit the level. Each room is littered with enemies, which Milon can take out by shooting them with bubbles. Enemies will all respawn over time. To progress, Milon will need to discover the plethora of secrets in each level, as almost nothing in the game is obvious.[CR]While this may sound fairly simple, the game is known for being extremely difficult. This is largely because of a barebones manual and its heavy reliance on "secrets" to progress in the game.I need lots of help, actually.[CR]Many of these secrets have little or no logic to them, such as shooting secret blocks that look no different than other blocks, using specific items in specific, unmarked places, and requirments to wait for mysterious item respawns. The player is given one life and the game ends upon dying. There are no save points, but the player is able to continue after collecting the first crystal ball by holding down the start button at the title screen (not in the manual). Many levels were designed to lead a player one way, when the real path was actually hidden in the most unobvious place possible. This leads to a lot of blind shooting and collecting in hopes of finding keys and musical instruments to progress. Enemies will infinitely respawn making it important to clear each room as quickly as possible, and avoid their quick, random patterns.[CR]Boss fights are extremely one sided taking dozens if not hundreds of hits to defeat any of the bosses and unlike in most 8 bit platformers where getting hit would give you a few precious seconds of invulnerability Milon is open to attacks immediately after getting hit. To regain health, Milon must gather hearts, which are randomly dropped by enemies. After defeating each boss, a crystal ball appears that strengthens Milons bubble or make its shooting distance further.[CR]Several hidden items can be found by breaking blocks that assist Milon in his quest:Honeycomb - adds an extra bar to Milon's health meter.Hudson Bee - creates a protective shield around Milon.Umbrella - allows for rapid fire bubbles.Music box - advances Milon to the bonus stage.Coins/Money - can be used to shop at the hidden shops.[CR]In order to beat the game players must do the following as is quoted from the manual. This is the only real direction given in terms of how to beat the game:[CR]"Enter the Castle and solve the puzzle of each maze-room. Find and save the hidden money and 12 helpful items. Destroy each of the seven demon-monsters lurking in the Castle and collect seven crystal balls. the crystal ball is your key to advance to the next level of the Castle. After completing everything above, you must find two secret items to save Queen Eliza. Those two items are for you to find....!"[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version is the same game but with fixes to a couple of problems from the NES version. An in game item menu and password system has been added for feathers. After-hit invincibility fixes the problem of a enemy draining your health down fast. The Game Boy version does have frame rate issue when there are two or more enemies on screen.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Hudson Soft USA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>13079</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563284-milons-secret-castle</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/milons-secret-castle</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/milons-secret-castle/3030-8291/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362071-nes_milonssecretcastle.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260030-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/84166-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388984-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-and.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388985-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-and.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388986-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-game-start.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388987-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-starting-location.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388988-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-jumping-for-joy.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388989-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-firing-my-weapon.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388990-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-i-entered-the-first.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388991-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-i-lost-all-my-energy.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388993-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388994-milon-s-secret-castle-game-boy-screenshot-i-entered-the-second.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Miner 2049er Starring Bounty Bob (USA)">		<description>Miner 2049er Starring Bounty Bob (USA)</description>		<rom crc="1A6BD577" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMiner%202049er%20Starring%20Bounty%20Bob%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="6F62BF7F88263470DFA61D6752B345573F10CD8F" size="29466" />		<title_clean>Miner 2049er Starring Bounty Bob</title_clean>		<plot>'Bounty Bob' is mining a radioactive mine in the year 2049.

Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.[CR]To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line.

When you lose all of your cites, then it's game over, and the game doesn't end until you lose and the inhabitants of the cities are killed. The original arcade release had you using a trackball to move a cursor around the screen, with the press of one of three buttons you could fire a missle from the appropriate missile turret. Each missile turret has 10 missiles per level, however your missiles have a wide explosion range, letting you destroy multiple incoming missiles with one blast. The game has a set number of incoming missiles per level, and as you go up in level, the number of incoming missiles increases, therefore increasing the difficulty. The overall goal of the game, like many games from the 70's and 80's is to get the highest  High Score.[CR] Bugs &amp; Glitches[CR]The original version has a bug that happens once you get to 810,000 points. You get awarded with 150 extra cities, making it possible to play the game for several more hours.Strategies[CR]After getting up to the 255th and 256th stages (known as the 0x stages) the scoring increases by 256 times, but the speed of the missiles also becomes accelerated. Expert players have been known to score over 1 million points, enabling some players to reach up to 2,800,000 points. The scoring system was primitive enough at the time where it would only show six-digits, so their 2,800,000 showed up as 800,000. After getting past the 256th stage, the game reverts back to the original speed from stage 1, but keeps your point total and your extra cities, making it possible to keep playing the game in a giant loop. [CR]Remakes[CR]Missile Command was originally released in  arcades in 1980 and ported to the  Atari 2600, from there it was made on the  Atari 5200 and the  Atari 8-bit, as well as other consoles. The game became so incredibly popular, that over the years it has been remade by various companies under different names, and sometimes even slightly different graphics. A few examples of these are  Commando Raid,  Lunar Command, and  Condition Red.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1999</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Hasbro Interactive</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>23336</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585806-missile-command</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/missile-command____</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/missile-command/3030-4062/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5295</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23336-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/23336-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/536118-missile-command-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/536119-missile-command-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/536120-missile-command-game-boy-screenshot-high-scores-list.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/536121-missile-command-game-boy-screenshot-cairo-is-the-first-city.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/536122-missile-command-game-boy-screenshot-defending-cairo.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/925988-0023.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/925987-0022.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/925986-0021.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/925985-0018.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/925984-0016.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mogu Mogu Gombo (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Mogu Mogu Gombo (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="85C984F2" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMogu%20Mogu%20Gombo%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="A4524D11F2A86E28BC319335B5C05EA6550B26E1" size="143606" />		<title_clean>Mogu Mogu Gombo</title_clean>		<plot>MoguMogu Gombo: Harukanaru Chou Ryouri Densetsu is a Role-Playing game, published by Bandai,which was released in Japan in 1995.</plot>		<releasedate>16/6/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Bandai</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569914-mogumogu-gombo-harukanaru-chou-ryouri-densetsu</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/7/6/306376_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/a/4/gfs_9003_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/7/4/gfs_9003_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/3/9/gfs_9003_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/e/9/gfs_9003_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/9/gfs_9003_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/9/gfs_9003_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/f/9/gfs_9003_2_5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/2/9/gfs_9003_2_6.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/9/gfs_9003_2_7.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/4/8/gfs_9003_2_8.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mogura de Pon!

Despite being affiliated with one of the most well-known individuals in interactive entertainment, the game has performed particularly poor in sales, and is considered one of the few commercially failed projects he has personally undertaken.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Jinbe's note informing Muddy of his capture.[CR]On a lazy day, Muddy Mole, his partner and seven children are relaxing in the woods. Suddenly farmer Jinbe, aggravated over the fact that the Mole family continues to steal his cabbages and create subterranean chaos, sweeps in and kidnaps Muddy's entire family. Therefore leaving Muddy to conquer Jinbe Land and face Jinbe himself in his castle.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An above ground view of a typical puzzling situation.[CR]Playing from a top-down perspective, the goal is to advance from screen to screen, each littered with obstacles and enemies. The objective on every single screen is the same: push, shove or throw the black bomb into the breakable exit in any way possible. Barrels and blocks can additionally be used to allow the explosive to cross gaps or as a means to stop it in its tracks. Though the opening stages looking fairly minimalist and simple in their design, later stages become devious and complex fairly quickly. The ending of each world concludes with a boss battle that has a specific theme along with the stage itself.[CR] The same dilemma now displayed beneath the surface.[CR]The defining characteristic of the title is it's use of underground travel. Every stage has an individual underground territory that Muddy can dig through. Holes can be used to traverse from above ground to below ground. The difficulty thus stems from the decision of where the player digs, as the bomb will re-appear at it's starting point as soon as it enters such a hole. Areas that are inaccessible normally may be traversable underground and vice versa. Later challenges include pipes that redirect the bomb and E.g. spikes that Muddy cannot cross, but the bomb is able to regardless.Enemies frequently impede Muddy's progress in more advanced levels.[CR]Furthermore, a multiplayer mode is available where players battle for supremacy over cabbages. The target being to collect more cabbages than the opponent in the allotted time. Cabbages, like in the main game, can be collected by moving them into cavities before the opposition.[CR]The game further includes support for the Super Game Boy; Enabling more colors and tones to be displayed on screen while simultaneously adding a custom-themed border.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The boss featured in World 7 has a striking resemblance to an enemy commonly seen in the Kirby franchise.If the player continually nags the Elder Mole (who grants the player health in special stages throughout the adventure) they will eventually get a Game Over.Cabbages feature an important role and when all 20 are collected in a single world, a special Cabbage challenge is unlocked where the player steals more cabbages from Jinbe.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1997</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2

If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Parker Brothers</studio>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21673</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585808-monopoly</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/monopoly</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/monopoly/3030-2958/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5298</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362073-nes_monopoly.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40028-monopoly-windows-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/150526-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202811-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/27971-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/150522-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299048-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/302312-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8832-monopoly-windows-screenshot-intro-animation-showing-title-and.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8833-monopoly-windows-screenshot-choosing-number-of-players-names.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8834-monopoly-windows-screenshot-spinning-your-dice-using-animations.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8835-monopoly-windows-screenshot-chance-card.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8836-monopoly-windows-screenshot-music-sound-selection-every-property.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8837-monopoly-windows-screenshot-moving-on-the-board.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8838-monopoly-windows-screenshot-moving-on-the-board-is-set-to-be.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8839-monopoly-windows-screenshot-train-station-buy-it-or-leave-it.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8840-monopoly-windows-screenshot-arriving-at-the-oriental-avenue.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8841-monopoly-windows-screenshot-card-statistics-and-tresspassing.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Monster Maker (Japan)">		<description>Monster Maker (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="725EE86C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMonster%20Maker%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="70D99059EF780033CD0844AB724CB0C1B4B3C839" size="94688" />		<title_clean>Monster Maker</title_clean>		<plot>Monster Maker is a Role-Playing game, published by Sofel,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>22/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Sofel</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/579904-monster-maker</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/8/7/311587_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/1/e/gfs_20796_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/8/3/gfs_20796_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/3/gfs_20796_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/e/3/gfs_20796_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/f/3/gfs_20796_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/4/3/gfs_20796_2_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/9/3/gfs_20796_2_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/2/3/gfs_20796_2_7.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/f/2/gfs_20796_2_8.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/4/2/gfs_20796_2_9.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Monster Maker -

In order to proceed, he needs to solve a series of puzzle-based isometric dungeons, collecting or destroying a specific object to complete the stage. After each floor is successfully cleared (three stages apiece), he ascends to the next, more difficult set.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Max is limited to basic movement in any stage initially, but can collect certain power-ups that increase his ability to explore and proceed past traps and obstacles. Usually, these items need to be found before he can complete the stage's objective. In a sense, it employs the Metroidvania system of incremental progression, except Max needs to collect these items each time and not all items appear in each stage. These items include:[CR]Boots - Allows Max to jump, to get over low obstacles.[CR]Duck - Allows Max to duck, to get through narrow gaps.[CR]Bag - Allows Max to collect blocks in the level, to use as mobile platforms.[CR]Sword - Allows Max to attack certain enemies, removing them.[CR]Super Spell - Allows Max to destroy all enemies on the screen, including those immune to the regular Spell and Sword. The Super Spell becomes the regular Spell afterwards.[CR]Spell - Allows Max to destroy certain enemies.[CR]Forcefield - Makes Max invincible but unable to move, useful for standing on moving platforms that travel past deadly traps.[CR]Stars - Allows Max to take a hit once without dying. They can be stacked.[CR]Spring - Allows Max to jump twice as high as usual, though disappears after so many uses.[CR]Map - Reveals the entire map for that stage.[CR]Gold Bars - A bonus item Max can collect for extra points, should he finish the stage.[CR]Saving[CR]Monster Max, though developed after the advent of battery back-ups for Game Boy games (notably The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening), does not include this feature. Instead, the game's progress is saved with a password system the player is required to record.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Titus France

After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesGreen Bolt - Throws a pale green fireball at the opponent.Shadow Kick - Throws a mid-kick while quickly moving towards the opponent, trailing pale green shadows behind him.Ball Breaker - Performs a split (a la Jean-Claude Van Damme) and punches his opponent's groin, temporarily stunning them.FatalityUppercut Decapitation - Johnny Cage performs a simple uppercut that punches the opponent's head clean off. In the Super Nintendo version, he impales his foot into his opponent's chest (which is later parodied in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks). In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code enabled), he just performs a simple Shadow Kick. In the Arcade version, it was possible to reset his Fatality, causing him to knock two heads off his opponent (which is somewhat parodied in Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Kano[CR](not available in the Game Gear and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Richard DivizioSpecial MovesKnife Throw - Throws a knife (that glows blue) at his opponent.Cannonball - Rolls up into a ball in mid-air and charges towards his opponent.FatalityHeart Rip - Kano shoves his hand into his opponent's chest and rips out the still-beating heart, which he displays in admiration. In the Super Nintendo version and Sega Genesis version (without the Blood Code activated), he just impales his opponent's chest with his fist. In the Game Boy version, he just glides towards his opponent with a kick.[CR]Raiden[CR](known as Rayden in the SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and PC versions)[CR]Actor: Carlos PesinaSpecial MovesLightning Blast - Throws a bolt of lightning at his opponent.Torpedo - Charges his opponent like a torpedo, chanting nonsensically.Teleport - Phases into the ground and reappears on the other side of the screen.FatalityElectrified Head Pop - Raiden sends jolts of electricity through the opponent's body until the head explodes. In the Super Nintendo version, the opponent is instead electrocuted into a skeleton, which quickly dissolves. In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), the electrocution doesn't do anything special to the opponent. In the Game Boy version, Raiden just turns into a pile of electricity and glides towards his opponent.[CR]Liu Kang[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFireball - Throws a red fireball at his opponent.Flying Kick - Performs a quick air kick that launches towards his opponent.FatalityCartwheel Uppercut - Liu Kang performs a cartwheel that ends with a powerful uppercut, sending the opponent flying. Because the developers wanted Liu Kang to be the "hero" character, his Fatality is not considered lethal. (However, it would be lethal on The Pit, as it knocks the opponent over the side of the bridge towards the spikes). In the Arcade and PC versions, it's possible to whiff the cartwheel if the player executes it from a full screen away from their opponent. When this happens, they're free to hit their opponent in any way they see fit, including executing the Fatality a second time. (In the SNES version, however, executing the cartwheel from a full screen away simply causes Liu Kang to cover more distance and come in contact with the victim.)[CR]Scorpion[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpear - Throws a spear at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), he shouts "COME HERE!" and drags his opponent towards him, temporarily stunning the opponent.Teleport Punch - Launches himself off one side of the screen and reappears in the other (while throwing a punch).FatalityHellfire - Scorpion takes out his mask, revealing a skull, and breathes fire onto his opponent, who turns into a charred skeleton.[CR]Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesFreeze Ball - Throws a ball of ice at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), his opponent will freeze in a block of ice temporarily, open for another attack. If he attempts to freeze a frozen opponent, this will trigger a "double freeze", in which his opponent thaws instantly and Sub-Zero himself is temporarily frozen.Slide Kick - Glides towards his opponent, performing a very low kick.FatalitySpine Rip - Sub-Zero grabs his opponent's head, rips it off (spine attached), and displays it towards the camera. In the Super Nintendo version, he jumps back, performs a more potent freeze on the opponent, jumps forward, and punches the opponent, who dissolves into chunks. (This is later improved on in Mortal Kombat II) In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), Sub-Zero just performs a more powerful uppercut. In the Game Boy version, Sub-Zero just glides towards his opponent with a punch.[CR]Sonya[CR]Actor: Elizabeth MaleckiSpecial MovesRing Toss - Throws a fireball consisting of three purple rings at her opponent.Leg Grab - Performs a handstand and attempts to grab her opponent with her legs. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), she throws her opponent over her with her legs.Square Wave Punch - Jumps straight up, then glides along the air while throwing a punch. (Similar to a square waveform)FatalityKiss of Death - Sonya blows a kiss, which ends up being a fireball that turns the opponent into a charred skeleton.[CR]Goro[CR](sub-boss, only playable in the Game Boy version with a cheat code)[CR] Special MovesFireball - Throws a powerful green fireball at his opponent.Leaping Stomp - Jumps off the top of the screen and lands on his opponent.Chest Pound - Grabs his opponent with his lower arms and wails against the body with his upper arms before throwing the opponent over his shoulder.[CR]Shang Tsung[CR](final boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFlaming Skull - Throws a series of flaming skulls at his opponent.Morph - Temporarily transforms to one of the other seven playable characters. In some occasions, he even transforms into Goro.[CR]Reptile[CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and early Arcade versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpearFreeze BallTeleport PunchSlide KickFatalityHellfireSpine Rip[CR]Arenas[CR]There are six playable stages (seven if the bottom of The Pit for the battle against Reptile is included), which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Goro's Lair is always the stage for Endurance 3, Goro, and Shang Tsung matches. The Pit is the only stage that includes a Stage Fatality, which is performed by a simple uppercut.The Pit. You do not want to know what lies below this bridge...The CourtyardPalace GatesWarrior ShrineThe PitThrone RoomGoro's Lair[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original arcade release of Mortal Kombat went through five revisions on two arcade boards (the Midway Y-Unit and then the Midway T-Unit). Some additions to the versions include the ability for players to play a mirror match, advertisements for promotional material, more blood, increased opponent AI, and the addition of Reptile.Almost a year later, Mortal Kombat was ported to various consoles (mainly Nintendo and Sega consoles), published by Acclaim. To hype the game's original release on home and handheld consoles, Acclaim launched a marketing blitz that labeled the game's September 13, 1993 release as "Mortal Monday", featuring the iconic Mortal Kombat theme song, known as Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat), in advertisements and promotional material.The original arcade release was later bundled with the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was part of Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe SNES version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Sculptured and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". This version was infamous as it did not contain any violence or gore (not even as a secret cheat code), due to the fact that Nintendo preferred family-friendly games for its consoles. The blood was replaced by a mist-like sweat and most Fatalities (known as Finishing Moves) were heavily censored. Anything involving decapitations or organ removal was significantly altered, although Scorpion, Sonya, and Liu Kang did not have any of their finishers censored.Despite the censorship, the game featured better graphics, sound, and music than most of the other console ports. Details such as the character size relative to the screen, the placement of their names within the life bars, and the composition and usage of the score were faithful to the arcade (even though the instrumentation from the SNES audio chip could not be as crisp as provided through the arcade version's sound chips).However, the gameplay was hampered significantly. Control felt relatively stiff, and it was very difficult to pull off basic combos (such as Liu Kang's jump kick into Flying Kick). In some cases, it felt like there was a slight but noticeable lag between a D-pad press and the resulting move on the screen. If you tapped the d-pad too quickly, it was possible to actually attempt multiple inputs without ever seeing a response on the screen (but it also made it possible to do Scorpion's fatality--up, up--without having to hold Block).Sega GenesisThe Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". It also featured censorship of violence and gore (with Fatalities even more censored than the SNES version). However, the game had a famous Blood Code (ABACABB, a nod to the album Abacab by the band Genesis) that, when entered at the right time, would disable all censorship.Despite being the more popular version due to the addition of the Blood Code, the game featured weak graphics and sound, including missing animations (such as Sub-Zero's idle and walking animations, which now mirror Scorpion's) and heavily modified music.Musically, there are stage-specific songs that are used in the wrong stages (and this seems to be something that occurs in most versions ported by Probe, including the PC version). For instance, in the "Palace Gates" stage, which is second in the stage rotation, the music that plays is nothing like what is heard in the original or SNES versions, but in fact sounds like a remixed version of the Continue Screen music. The "Palace" stage music does exist in this version, but is instead used in the "Warrior Shrine" stage (the next stage over).Curiously, not only is "The Pit" stage music completely wrong, it is also the same track that Probe used for the "Palace Gates" stage in the PC floppy disk port.In addition, this version is missing the ominous chime when a Fatality is performed successfully; instead, the stage music continues to play until the animation is over. (The voiceover for "____ Wins" and "Fatality" is also missing.)Game BoyThe Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". Due to technical issues, this version of the game is considered the worst due to poor controls and timing issues. The game also lacked Johnny Cage and Reptile, and was censored to contain no blood or gore. However, this is the only version where Goro is made playable through a cheat code.Sega Game GearThe Sega Game Gear version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". It resembles much like an improved Game Boy version, featuring faster gameplay, color, and tighter controls. Like the Sega Genesis version, the game was censored until the player enters a hidden Blood Code. Kano and Reptile were absent from the game.Sega Master SystemReleased exclusively in Europe, the Sega Master System version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim in 1993. The game is the same as the Sega Game Gear version, only with more screen visibility.Sega CDThe Sega CD version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim in mid-1994, featuring an improved Sega Genesis version (with no censorship and better graphics, music and sound). The game also features video from the "Mortal Monday" advertisements and some tracks from the music CD as bonus content. However, due to the nature of CD-based games, the game suffered from load times (even during endurance matches and the Shang Tsung match). The manual for the Sega CD version also included tidbits from the comic book series.PCThe PC version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Midway and Probe, and published by Acclaim in mid-1994 and is considered the most faithful port in terms of graphics and gameplay. For the floppy disk version, the synthesized music and sounds via Sound Blaster cards were less than ideal; it suffered from melodic inconsistencies similar in nature to the Genesis version. The CD version, however, featured authentic music and sounds and is considered the best home version for its time.AmigaThe Amiga version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Virgin in 1994. The game plays similar to the Sega Genesis version, complete with censorship that can be bypassed with the Blood Code. Due to the limited controls on the Amiga, all moves can be performed with the joystick and one punch button. (Though a second button can be used as a kick button) The game suffered from loading times and a sub-par arranged soundtrack.Plug It In &amp; Play TV GamesIn 2004, JAKKS Pacific released Mortal Kombat as part of their Plug It In &amp; Play TV Games lineup. The port, developed by Digital Eclipse, is a slightly watered-down version of the Arcade version, including cheap MIDI music and lack of scrolling backgrounds and flashing text. The joypad itself resembled a modified Sega Genesis controller with the classic Mortal Kombat 5-button layout. The only way to play two player battles was to connect another copy of the joypad to the first joypad.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Goro[CR]Beat the game, and then wait for the credits to finish.</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>2.8</rating>		<videoid>y0DE14j2o-Y</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13103</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563285-mortal-kombat</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mortal-kombat</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5305</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13103-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210303-mortal-kombat-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/193979-mortal-kombat-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210304-mortal-kombat-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20635-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20636-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-goro-lives.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20638-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-goro.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20639-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-kano-vs-rayden-1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20641-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-kano-vs-rayden-2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20642-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-liu-kang-vs-scorpion-1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20643-mortal-kombat-game-boy-screenshot-liu-kang-vs-scorpion-2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/a/gfs_28969_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/a/gfs_28969_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/a/gfs_28969_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/13103-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/FZJthVg.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/13103.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Mortal Kombat &amp; Mortal Kombat II (USA, Europe)">		<description>Mortal Kombat &amp; Mortal Kombat II (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="55300D0A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMortal%20Kombat%20%26%20Mortal%20Kombat%20II%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="E337489255B33367CE26194FC4038346D3388BD9" size="327720" />		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat &amp; Mortal Kombat II</title_clean>		<plot>Mortal KombatThe #1 arcade smash that started it all is here!Mortal Kombat IIThe Kombat Kontinues... the fierce Kombatants of Mortal Kombat II battle to defeat Shao Kahn!Nothing can prepare you...Together on one game pak for the first time the ultimate fighting experience...Mortal Kombat &amp; Mortal Kombat II - The Most lethal combo ever created!!![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Beat the game, and then wait for the credits to finish.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]To do the code.

The game was later overshadowed by its upgrade:  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.[CR]Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's "cyber-assassin" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Mortal Kombat "X" Control Panel with the new run button[CR]The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a "Run Meter", which limits the use of running.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a "chain combo" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny![CR]The game also introduces the concept of "Choose Your Destiny", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different "towers", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).[CR]In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a "Kombat Kode") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.[CR]When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an "Ultimate Kombat Kode"). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working "Ultimate Kombat Kode" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character.Finishing MovesANIMALITY![CR] Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).[CR]Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Characters and Actors[CR] The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)[CR]The game includes fourteen playable starter characters, two unplayable bosses, one playable secret character, and one unplayable secret opponent. Jax, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung return from Mortal Kombat II alongside Kano and Sonya from the original Mortal Kombat as starting playable characters. Each character from the previous games have a different appearance, such as Jax's metal arms and an un-masked Sub-Zero. Shao Kahn returns from Mortal Kombat II as the game's final boss.[CR]The other playable starter characters include the  palette swaps Cyrax and Sektor (Lin Kuei cyber-assassins sent to kill Sub-Zero), Kabal (a former warrior of Kano's clan), Nightwolf (a North American  shaman), Stryker (a  riot control officer), Sheeva (a female  Shokan warrior), and the resurrected Sindel. Motaro replaces  Kintaro as Shao Kahn's bodyguard and penultimate boss.[CR]The game includes two secret characters, one of which (Smoke from Mortal Kombat II as an indoctrinated cyber-assassin palette swap) is unlocked as a playable character via an "Ultimate Kombat Kode". The other, Noob Saibot (also from Mortal Kombat II), can only be fought through a special "Kombat Kode". Although we're given the impression that Noob Saibot is a ninja (similar to Mortal Kombat II), he is simply a palette swap of Kano in this game. Shang Tsung - John Turk Sindel - Lia Montelongo Jax - John Parrish Kano - Richard Divizio Liu Kang - Eddie Wong Sonya - Kerri Hoskins Stryker - Michael O'Brien Smoke - Sal Divita (secret character) Sub-Zero - John Turk Cyrax - Sal Divita Sektor - Sal Divita Nightwolf - Sal Divita Sheeva - Stop-motion miniature Kung Lao - Anthony Marquez Kabal - Richard Divizio Motaro - Stop-motion miniature (boss, unplayable) Shao Kahn - Brian Glynn (final boss, unplayable) Noob Saibot - Richard Divizio (secret opponent, unplayable)Arenas[CR]There are eleven playable stages (thirteen if Noob Saibot's Dorfen is counted, where the player fights Noob Saibot, and Hidden Portal, where they fight Smoke), which is built into a simple, looping rotation. However, The Balcony is always the stage in Motaro matches and The Pit 3 is always the stage in Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include Stage Fatalities are The Subway (in which the player uppercuts the opponent into the adjacent tracks, who gets run over by a subway car), The Bell Tower (in which the player uppercuts the opponent down the Bell Tower through many floors, who then gets impaled by spikes), and The Pit 3 (in which the player uppercuts the opponent over the side of the bridge and into rotating blades below).[CR]A new addition to Mortal Kombat stages is mid-match stage transitions, where a simple uppercut can knock the opponent up into another stage. The Subway transitions to The Street, The Bank transitions to The Rooftop, and The Soul Chamber transitions to The Balcony. The Subway  The Bank The Street The Graveyard  The Rooftop The Balcony The Bridge The Soul Chamber The Bell Tower The Church The Graveyard The Pit 3[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]16-bit conversions for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo were released on September 8, 1995, along with a Game Boy version as well. A rare Game Gear version of MK3 was made but only saw a release in Japan and Europe. MK3 was an early member of the Sony PlayStation library, as a 32-bit conversion was released on October 7, 1995, less than a month after the PlayStation launched in North America. As part of its battle with Sega Saturn over the 32-bit market, Sony bought exclusive rights from Midway to release the game on 32-bit consoles. As a response, Sega purchased exclusive 32-bit rights to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Two versions of MK3 were released for PC. One version was strictly made for DOS. The other version was the PlayStation version ported over for Windows. An emulated version of the game was included on Midway Arcade Teasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2004. It also was featured on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PSP in 2005 and Midway Arcade Teasures Deluxe Edition for the PC in 2006. Deluxe featured a 1995 10-minute documentary about the making of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Kombat Kodes[CR]At the Versus Screen....[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] More Credits[CR]At the main screen (where it shows the credits) keep pressing the Up Button.

Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic "Toasty!" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an "X" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no "endurance matches" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the "?" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the "Toasty!" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row).

The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an "ice grenade" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he "bursts out" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand.

The victim then stands in shock as showers of blood gush through his/her arm sockets. The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable)[CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on &#8220;Mortal Friday&#8221; September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Fighter Select[CR]To do the code.

Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic "Toasty!" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an "X" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no "endurance matches" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the "?" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the "Toasty!" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row).

The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an "ice grenade" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he "bursts out" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand. What remains of the victim is a shriveled, desiccated body.Hidden Fatality: Shang Tsung morphs into Kintaro and, with one powerful punch, knocks his victim's torso clean off of his/her legs.[CR]         Kitana [CR]Actor:  Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Kitana whips out her razor-sharp fan and decapitates her victim.Fatality 2: Kitana plants a lovely kiss on her victim which in fact causes the victim's body to expand to the point of explosion.[CR]      Jax [CR]Actor:  John Parrish Fatality 1: Jax claps both of his hands on the victim's head, causing it to shatter into pieces.Fatality 2: Jax grabs ahold of both of his victim's arms and rips them off with one yank. The victim then stands in shock as showers of blood gush through his/her arm sockets. The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable)[CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on &#8220;Mortal Friday&#8221; September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Fighter Select[CR]To do the code.

The game contained several elements that made it stand-out compared with other 1980s era motorcycle racing video games; namely the full circular loops and the heightened sense of  speed, both of which were visually impressive on the Game Boy&#8217;s screen. The game required the player to acquire and use certain power-ups at appropriate times in order to access a track&#8217;s fastest path, such as by hopping on top of a ledge, etc.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/1/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Sports</genre>		<studio>Ultra Software Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>YTDGZFbng3c</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18674</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585813-motocross-maniacs</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/motocross-maniacs</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/motocross-maniacs/3030-19879/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13071</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2345127-box_mm.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206835-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30302-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191137-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20470-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20471-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-screenshot-exiting-a-loop.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20472-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-screenshot-go.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20473-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-screenshot-pick-up-power-ups.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20474-motocross-maniacs-game-boy-screenshot-crazy-loop-jump-combo.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/2/2/gfs_2335_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/f/2/gfs_2335_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/b/b/gfs_54861_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/6/b/gfs_54861_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/5/gfs_199728_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/sp5dQI4.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Mouse Trap Hotel (USA)">		<description>Mouse Trap Hotel (USA)</description>		<rom crc="6EDF07E5" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FMouse%20Trap%20Hotel%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="301658FD29B1A9277690A3C6E43DC68C8A277C1D" size="39138" />		<title_clean>Mouse Trap Hotel</title_clean>		<plot>Mouse Trap Hotel is an Action game, developed by Imagineering Inc and published by Electro Brain, which was released in 1992.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/585814.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start With 8 More Lives[CR]At the Title Screen, quickly press Up, Down, B, Select, Right, Start.

Help him eat his favorite snack, the delectable peach, by using laser emitting bowls to trap enemies and making them safe to chomp up.   As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button.  If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches.  Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin's score is measured in calories).  When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place.  Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one.[CR]Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks.  Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Romstar Incorporated</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<videoid>EQ2oNflzvOE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21677</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585815-mr-chins-gourmet-paradise</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/mr-chins-gourmet-paradise</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mr-chins-gourmet-paradise/3030-3886/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21677-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145372-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214271-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214272-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-he-looks-so.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214273-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-you-can-t-eat.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214274-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-but-you-can.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214275-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-passed-the.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214276-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-trap-enemies.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214277-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-activating.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214278-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-a-bonus-stage.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214279-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-in-this-stage.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214280-mr-chin-s-gourmet-paradise-game-boy-screenshot-enemies-can.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Mr. Do!

Mr. Do is capable of digging both horizontal and vertical tunnels. Apart from cherries, the levels also features apples. Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special "powerball" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.[CR]The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found.[CR]Food[CR]There are many types of food that give you a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill you!

The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.[CR]The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.[CR]Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles.

These transformations are not random, but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you'll find out all possible transformations.[CR]The make it all a little bit more interesting, there are monsters inhibiting the maze.

The player character can jump and throw nails at his enemies. Apart from killing enemies, nails can also serve as platform when they are thrown into blocks. Some blocks can be destroyed when you throw a nail into them and jump on the nail, whereas other blocks cannot even be penetrated by the nails. As the game progresses, levels get more and more complicated and new types of nails,such as explosive nails that remove particularly resilient blocks, become available.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Data East Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21683</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585820-nail-n-scale</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/nailn-scale</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/nailn-scale/3030-120/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21683-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260146-nail-n-scale-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260147-nail-n-scale-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97388-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97389-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-throwing-nails-at-your-enemies.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97390-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-using-a-nail-as-platform.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97391-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-nails-can-be-shot-in-all-directions.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97392-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-jumping-on-a-nail-to-crush.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97393-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-now-how-do-i-get-to-that-door.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97403-nail-n-scale-game-boy-screenshot-cleave-your-way-through-lots.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/6/b/gfs_38667_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/1/6/gfs_81951_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/c/6/gfs_81951_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Nakajima Satoru -

When you've chosen the level that you want, press [B]Start[/B] to go there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]On most revisions of Galaga, there's a trick that stops enemies from firing at your ship.  In Stage 1, kill all aliens except the two bees in the bottom-left corner.  Allow the bees to dive down and shoot at you, while dodging their shots.  After around 15 minutes or so, the bees will continue to drop down, but they won't fire.  Let them drop down another 5 or 6 times, then kill them.  After all this, enemies will not shoot at you for the rest of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Wait until one of the top ships(the green ones that take two shots to kill) comes down and fires off a tractor beam(the beam that can capture your ship).  Let it capture your ship.  Now, wait until it swoops down again with your ship behind it.  Simply kill the head ship(the green one), and it will lose your ship.  Your ship will then lock on to the side of your current ship, giving you two ships to play with at the same time!  Now, be careful.  Not only will both ships be firing at you after your ship gets captured, but if you accidently shoot your captured ship, you'll destroy it.  Also note, this will cost you one life, but will definately make the Challenging Stages, and perhaps the game itself, a little easier to play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR][B]Note[/B]:  This works in [B]all[/B] non-bootleg/hack versions of [I]Galaga[/I], as well as most of the sequels and Arranged Mode in [I]Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1[/I].</plot>		<releasedate>21/7/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Compilation</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569918-namco-gallery-vol-1</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/namco-gallery-vol-1</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/namco-gallery-vol-1/3030-41155/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2412520-vol1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/7/8/306378_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/3/c/gfs_8477_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/e/c/gfs_8477_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/5/c/gfs_8477_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/4/c/gfs_8477_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/f/c/gfs_8477_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/2/c/gfs_8477_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/a/1/gfs_8477_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/7/1/gfs_8477_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Namco Gallery Vol.2 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Namco Gallery Vol.2 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="A69B9260" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FNamco%20Gallery%20Vol.2%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="02B1D728A8C722BD2299C44B54BEB4DE6EB70E4F" size="306570" />		<title_clean>Namco Gallery Vol.2</title_clean>		<plot>[CR]Includes:GalaxianDig DugThe Tower of DruagaFamista 4[CR]Famista 4[CR]Famista (Family Stadium) 4 is the fourth Game Boy incarnation of the popular baseball series.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series and became exceptionally popular in arcades, generating over $1 billion in revenue for the company. Mark Turmell is the game's main programmer and designer, and its gameplay is based on the game Arch Rivals, which Midway released in 1989.[CR]Due to the success of NBA Jam, an updated version of the game called NBA Jam Tournament Edition was released a year and a half later. Featuring updated rosters and adding a number of new features to the series. Midway also used the success of NBA Jam to apply the over-the-top nature of the game to other sports. For example, Midway went on to create NFL Blitz, an over-the-top version of American football, in 1997.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 arcade-style basketball game that features over-the-top gameplay. The exaggerated nature of the gameplay means that players can perform gravity defying dunks with ease and shove opposing players down without penalty. Each game consists of four 3 minute long quarters, and the team with the most points at the end of the fourth quarter wins the game. When starting a match players have the option to enter their initials in order to keep track of their win-loss record and teams that they have beaten.[CR]The only fouls a player can commit in NBA Jam are goal tending and shot clock violations. This means that the player can shove opposing players (and even his own teammate) down in order to get the ball without commiting a foul. A shot clock is present in order to keep the game moving at a fast pace and goal tending is used to prevent players from hoarding the basket while on defense.[CR]A trademark of the NBA Jam series is the ability for players to catch on fire. This occurs when a player makes three consecutive unanswered shots. While on fire the player is nearly unstoppable; the player is granted unlimited turbo, increased accuracy, and can't be called for goal tending. A player's fire goes out when the opposing team makes a basket.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]*Note: The arcade version features teams from the 92-93 NBA season, while the home version include players from the 93-94 season. Shaq only appears in the arcade version of the game, he does not appear in the home versions of the game because the cost to renew the right to license him was deemed too high.[CR] Easter EggsDra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; haunts the arcade version of NBA Jam, allegedly.Dra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; died in a car accident between the game's home version port. It is believed that he haunts the arcade version of the game by causing the announcer to call his name out at random.NBA Jam is well known for featuring many odd hidden characters that can be unlocked via the game's initial entry. The home versions of the game added "celebrity" characters, while the arcade release focused more on the team responsible for developing the game. Unlockable players include:Bill ClintonAl GoreSal DivitaMark TurmellNBA Jam also includes cheats that enhance a players stats, these include: always on fire, infinite turbo and super dunks.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Cheats[CR]Enter one of the codes below at the Match-up screen for the desired effect.

In total, the game featured over 120 NBA athletes and over 40 hidden characters. Improvements include additional power-ups, more detailed player attributes, player substitutions after each quarter, and a new soundtrack. The namesake "Tournament Mode" turns off all cheats and powerups, and rewards players with expanded rosters for nearly all teams if the player beats all 27 teams.[CR]In addition to these features, console releases added practice and &#8220;juice&#8221; modes, optional game toggles like "hotspots" and powerup icons, and an "injury" stat that lowers a character's stats. Later console releases ( Jaguar, Saturn, PlayStation) also featured larger character sprites and scaling effects to match those of the arcade version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the "Turbo" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.[CR]The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player would send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure your lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.[CR]Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, powerups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the "???" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the "Quick Hands" and "Max Power" powerups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocked 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.[CR]All versions of the game also included "Powerup" codes input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These were secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that granted abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.[CR]An owner dipswitch option in the arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up.ConsolesHotspots enabled[CR]Some additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. "Hot Spots" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. "Power-up" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant "on fire," or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a "Juice" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.[CR]The console releases also added an "Injury" stat for each player. This stat would increase as the player was repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions were also increased to each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also added a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.[CR]Console releases also include an optional "Tag Mode" where you always control the player holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions.Computer AI Analysis[CR]The computer artificial intelligence seems to have two different modes. In one mode (mostly seen in early tournament matches) the computer adopts a more passive defensive strategy. They will rarely ever try to push the player over, and the player can often simply run the length of the court and put up a three, or go for an easy dunk without ever worrying about passing. On offense, they tend to often go for three pointers, and will almost always make them if the player doesn't steal or block the ball first (especially if the player is ahead in score). The AI will rarely ever go inside the paint for a lay up or a dunk in this mode.[CR]In the second mode (mostly seen in later tournament matches) the computer is much more aggressive. They will often try to push the player over, making it almost impossible to progress the ball up the length of the court without passing the ball to the other player frequently. Also, if the player tries to put up a three, they will almost always get shoved by the opposing computer controlled AI player if he is nearby. This makes it hard to get three pointers up, and the player can end up getting pummeled if they do not pass frequently. On offense, the AI will frequently go for dunks and attack the paint. However, if the player leaves them wide open on the perimeter they will pull up a three and make it almost all the time.[CR]In general, AI in the first mode is much easier to deal with than the aggressive second mode. The one advantage the first mode has to the second mode is on the offensive side because they will often go for three pointers and will make them almost all the time meaning they can come back quickly if the player is sloppy on the offensive end. However, because of the second modes extremely aggressive defensive, it is more often than not much harder to deal with. Though if the player can manage to get a huge lead on them, it is a lot harder for this mode to make a come back because they often don't put up three pointers.Always going for dunks is a good strategy when in the lead[CR]However, it is hard to get a big lead on either types of AI because of the Rubber Band AI effect. As the player's lead grows, the probability of making shots becomes progressively lower, while the AI's probability of success progressively increases. One strategy to deal with this is to always go for dunks when you start to get a lead bigger than two possessions (4 points), because dunks have a very high probability of going in. Likewise, never go for three pointers because the probability of a three pointer going in is very small when you have a lead. Also increasing your defense on the perimeter is recommended because the computer's probability of making a three pointer when you have a big lead is nearly 100%. This is why the second computer AI mode is easier to get a big lead on because they tend to not go for three pointers and have tougher defense on the perimeter than they do in the paint.[CR]It is interesting to note that if, in the last seconds before half-time or the end of the match, the computer has the ball and they throw up a full court shot it will always go in (a 100% probability) regardless of the score, but if they advance the ball to half court and shoot it from there their probability of making the shot is significantly reduced. For the player, the probability of making a full court shot is very small, giving the computer a competitive edge at the end of the game. Also in the last ten seconds before halftime or the end of the game the computer will become extremely aggressive (even more so than the second AI mode) regardless of the type of AI the player may be facing. If the player has the ball the computer will sprint full speed towards him/her and try to steal the ball and take a quick shot. So if the player is not careful, the computer can score 4 or 6 points in the final 10 seconds using quick steals and shots.[CR]Teams and Players[CR]NBA Team RostersKevin WillisAtlanta Hawks: Stacey Augmon, Mookie Blaylock, Kevin WillisBoston Celtics: Dee Brown, Dino Radja, Dominique Wilkins ( Xavier McDaniel, Eric Montross)Charlotte Hornets: Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning ( Dell Curry, Hersey Hawkins)Chicago Bulls: B.J.

Rather than porting the arcade game to the Game Boy, as with Double Dragon and Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones, Technos chose to adapt the Japanese brawler Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun: Bangai Rountouhen (a game in the same franchise as Renegade and River City Ransom) into a Double Dragon game.Double Dragon II on the Game Boy; a localized version of a Japan only beat-em-up[CR]In this version of the game, players control Billy Lee, being hunted by the Scorpions (a gang; Billy has been framed for killing one of their members). After fighting various members of the Scorpions, Billy faces off against the real murderer, Anderson. Featuring cooperative play through a Game Boy Link Cable, a second player can play as Jimmy Lee.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the Game Boy version of Double Dragon. Players can punch, kick, and kneel (by pressing both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously). After kneeling down, the character can perform a special jump uppercut by hitting either of the buttons. Additionally, players can grab enemies and then throw them. Unlike other versions of Double Dragon II, the Game Boy game has a total of eleven levels spanning across three stages (although the eleventh level is only available on Normal or Hard; not Easy).[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>7/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Technos Japan Corp.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<videoid>gf9EwVNk_Co</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13065</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563268-double-dragon-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/nekketsu-kha-kunio-kun-bangai-ranthen</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/double-dragon-ii/3030-5423/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13065-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/275519-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/275520-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195517-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195518-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195519-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195521-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195522-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195523-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195524-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195525-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195527-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/195528-nekketsu-koha-kunio-kun-bangai-rantohen-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu - Kyouteki!

Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/gradius[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Ultra</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.0</rating>		<videoid>idKzxf5GeyY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18365</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585827-nemesis</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/nemesis</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/nemesis/3030-28016/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/26763/1122730-box_scan015.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/18365-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67846-nemesis-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103538-nemesis-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119880-nemesis-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/209866-nemesis-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20904-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20905-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20906-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20907-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20908-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-level-3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20909-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-level-4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/20910-nemesis-game-boy-screenshot-level-5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/b/9/gfs_96848_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/6/9/gfs_96848_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/7/a/gfs_2336_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Nemesis II (Japan)">		<description>Nemesis II (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="AC5B062D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FNemesis%20II%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="F2797D5FA272CECC8CE89F6326A29CAD332F72D1" size="131853" />		<title_clean>Nemesis II</title_clean>		<plot>Gradius: The Interstellar Assault is an Action game, developed and published by Konami,which was released in Japan in 1991.</plot>		<releasedate>14/1/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>Konami</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.0</rating>		<videoid>3IKUa6qwcSk</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21646</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585734-gradius-the-interstellar-assault</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/gradius-the-interstellar-assault/3030-4072/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21646-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/7/7/46277_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/d/b/gfs_38610_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/0/b/gfs_38610_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/b/gfs_38610_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/a/b/gfs_38610_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/2/6/gfs_89035_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/e/3/gfs_89036_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/4/6/gfs_38610_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/9/6/gfs_38610_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/2/6/gfs_38610_2_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/3/6/gfs_38610_2_4.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Nemesis II -

Ninja Taro plays much like a Legend of Zelda game using similar elements and puzzles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]This can only be done after the events that take place in Ogre Castle late in the game. When you're done entirely with that area, return to the house of Kondo's daughter, which is just one screen west of Omi Village's outside area. Speak with Kondo's daughter to get an unlimited supply of ladders![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]Normally, throughout the course of the game, you will be forced to only obtain one Water Spider from the Geko Castle area, with the rest of them (as many dungeons require multiple Water Spiders) being dropped on rare occasions by enemies. There is a way to make sure your supply, however, is unlimited, greatly making your journey easier. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]When you discover the secret in the Wind Scroll, head to Geko Castle and into the southeastern well's cave. Soon, you will come to an area (the seventh screen total) where there is a backwards-"L" protrusion from the northern wall. Go north from this screen to the next. (The spikes you see blocking the way are some you can walk on, at least the westernmost two sets.) In the next area, go northwest and use a Water Spider to cross the river there. Then go east from the treasure chest you find and navigate through the spikes as you did with the entrance to this area (some are fake). Cross the river again when next possible, then cross the river one more time when that path ends. Go north and west from there, past some more fake spikes, to the staircase. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]This will lead to an otherwise-inaccessible passage in the ninja master's house. Go south from where you appear and you will go through the wall. Speak with him and he will allow you to have an unlimited supply of Water Spiders![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Defense-Boosting Pickups[CR]Note that this trick can only be executed when you obtain the consumable version (i.e. the one you actually use) of the Offering item. Head to the unnamed village you first visited near the very start of the game, then go one screen east of there. In the southern portion of that area is a mushroom statue - use the Offering on that statue to create a bridge. That bridge will take you to a portion of the area where an enemy will continually reappear upon its death and will almost always drop heart-emblazoned pickups, which are used to boost your defense and thus lessen the damage you take.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>American Sammy</studio>		<rating>9.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21685</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585835-ninja-taro</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-taro/3030-34674/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21685-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/3/gfs_38675_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/3/gfs_38675_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/b/3/gfs_38675_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/3/gfs_81952_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/e/gfs_38675_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/e/gfs_38675_2_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/2/e/gfs_38675_2_3.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/3/e/gfs_38675_2_4.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/8/e/gfs_38675_2_5.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/e/gfs_38675_2_6.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ninku (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Ninku (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="B50119EB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FNinku%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="44B35AE3AA21D42D67B04A8581A0C83DC96521CE" size="212201" />		<title_clean>Ninku</title_clean>		<plot>Ninku is an Action game, developed by TOSE and published by Tomy Corporation,which was released in Japan in 1995.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Pochi the dog.[CR]On the character select screen, in Taisen mode, press the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Pochi the dog.[CR]On the character select screen, in Taisen mode, press the following:</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569604-ninku</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ninku/3030-44053/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2552561-ninku.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/9/2/gfs_7388_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/4/2/gfs_7388_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/2/gfs_7388_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/2/gfs_7388_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/2/gfs_7388_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/8/2/gfs_7388_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/0/f/gfs_7388_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/d/f/gfs_7388_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Ninku Dai-2-dan -

It was published by Nintendo and developed by    Technos Japan Corporation.  The soccer (football) in the game is six on six between many different countries including East Germany and West Germany.  You can play soccer on grass, sand, ice and dirt.  The game was designed by the same developers of   River City Ransom and such, the players have large heads and short legs.  In fact, many of the same sprites used in River City Ransom are used in World Cup.  The game also features some of the most addicting music ever on the NES. When it comes to slide tackles, there are no fouls.  It is encouraged to take out players via slide tackle to take the ball from them.  Also, if you tackle a player enough times, the player will get injured and will no longer be able to play.  Instead, the player would remain unconscious on the field until a goal was scored.  The tackle animations are quite pleasing.   Players are given five super shots per half and can be used by performing a header or a bicycle kick.  Each country had its own unique supershot.  What is unique about these shots is how crazy they were.  Some would look like they are going one direction then go another and some would go so fast you could barely see them.Also, every first game is against Cameroon for some reason.Nintendo World Cup's Multiplayer mode allows players to choose the type of field they would play on.  Available choices include sand, grass, dirt, and ice.  These alternative surfaces have a big effect on gameplay.  The dirt field has big rocks that could trip players, even so far as to injure them enough so the player would lie unconscious on the field.  The ice field makes players slide around, while the sand field slows the ball's movement considerably. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords for All Teams[CR]These passwords work for all 13 teams.

Erikawa had initially developed the game as a hobby alongside running Koei, which at the time was a chemical wholesaler. However, when he finished the game and had it published, it became such a smash success that Erikawa converted Koei into a video game studio and set to work on video games full-time. For his future projects, Erikawa took on the pen name Kou Shibusawa. Originally released on the PC-8801 and FM-7 computers in 1983, versions have been produced for the PC, NES, Genesis, Game Boy, SNES, and numerous other platforms.[CR]Nobunaga's Ambition is the first in a long-running series of historical strategy games set against Japan's Warring States era. Its title refers to Nobunaga Oda, one of the most powerful warlords of the era, who was on a path to unifying Japan under his rule until his assassination in 1582. In the game, the player attempts to do what Nobunaga could not, and unite all of Japan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As the title suggests, the player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Nobunaga Oda; the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Nobunaga Oda is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimyos of the era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player may choose from four campaign scenarios including:Battle for the East (beginning in 1560)Daimyo Power Struggles (1560)Ambition Untamed (1571)Road Towards Unification (1582)The territorial map of Japan.[CR]In each scenario, the player must first select a daimyo to play as, and also determine the daimyo's statistics, which are defined by Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm, and IQ. Each statistic is ranked on a hundred-point scale. The progression of time is structured in a turn-based manner. When in the map view, the passing of a turn corresponds to a change in season, and each turn during battle corresponds to the passing of a single day. As time passes, daimyos and officers age and will eventually die of natural causes. As the game progresses, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, encourage a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty.[CR]Battles take place in maps that are divided into 5x10 grids with terrain types such as hills, mountains, villages, rivers, plains, and castles. The player may achieve victory in battle through numerous means, among which include forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.[CR]Outside of battle, the player can make numerous decisions that affect domestic and diplomatic policy as well as military decisions that affect troop strength and allocation. Such actions include transporting soldiers, rice and gold between fiefs, which can be used to strengthen regions at the expense of others. Taxes may be raised or lowered to adjust the income level and the land may be cultivated to boost productivity, though raising taxes or choosing to cultivate will also lead to a decrease in loyalty among the peasants. Expanding a town allows for greater tax income, as well, but also leads to a reduction in loyalty. If loyalty drops too low, the peasants may rise up in rebellion.[CR]To ward against floods, the player can adjust the level of flood control, though the higher the control, the lower the productivity. It is also possible to recruit soldiers or ninja for the military, train the troops, and provide rice to the peasants and troops as a means to raise morale. On the diplomatic side, in addition to going to war, it is also possible to encourage good relations between rival factions by ratifying a non-aggression pact or arranging a marriage. Alternatively, the player can also send spies to keep tabs on rivals or work to win over a rival's own peasants. Merchants can be approached in order to buy weapons, buy or sell rice, or borrow money. It is also possible for the player character daimyo to fall ill, and so if necessary, the player may need to spend time to recuperate.[CR]If a player does not wish to control every aspect of governing, it is also possible to allow the computer AI to govern aspects of selected fiefs.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Nobunaga's Ambition series has garnered several awards over the years. According to Koei's website, various releases in the series have won Log-In magazine's "BHS Prize", the "Minister of Post &amp; Telecommunications Prize", Nikkei BP's 12th, 13th and 14th annual "Best PC Software" awards, and CD-ROM Fan's "Fan of the Year 2001 Grand Prize".[CR]In North America, where it was released almost five years after its Japanese release, critical reception was also positive. Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World enjoyed the game greatly, and in the September 1988 issue rated it as "Highly Recommended", with a score of 4/5 stars. He introduced the game as "a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century." He praised the graphics for being "among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM" and the 5x10 hex map battles, and noted that it used RPG elements, including assigning various statistics and attributes to a selected persona, a time system where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a multiplayer option. In his review, he noted, "This reviewer was glued to his computer for 13 hours, stopping at 3:00 am. Not since Gunship has this occurred. The end result is that the computer gamer must have, at least, one Koei game in his inventory!" Compute! similarly praised the IBM PC version, calling it "one of the best strategic war games ever designed for a personal computer" and citing the game play, user interface, and documentation.[CR] [CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/3/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>KOEI Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21686</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585837-nobunagas-ambition</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/nobunagas-ambition</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/nobunagas-ambition/3030-14028/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3413/222388-nobunaga_s_ambition_1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206980-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/176419-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443903-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443904-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-us-version.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443905-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-which-daimyo-do-you.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443906-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-you-are-therefore.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443907-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-there-is-an-uprising.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443908-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-what-are-your-commands.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443909-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-view-which-samurai.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443910-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-there-is-civil-war.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443911-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-battle.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443912-nobunaga-s-ambition-game-boy-screenshot-attacking-a-unit.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Nontan to Issho - Kurukuru Puzzle (Japan)">		<description>Nontan to Issho - Kurukuru Puzzle (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="6CD63B0B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FNontan%20to%20Issho%20-%20Kurukuru%20Puzzle%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="D9B2D7A30B68C8BBD4F91203A475B64B410A25AE" size="61238" />		<title_clean>Nontan to Issho - Kurukuru Puzzle</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle ("Nontan and Friends: Round-and-Round Puzzle") is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and Game Boy. It was released exclusively in Japan and is based on the Nontan books for younger children that follows the eponymous mischievous kitten and his animal friends on their adventures. The game is a twist on the standard block-stacking puzzle game.[CR]Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is one of the few games that Game Freak worked on before they created their breakout hit Pok&#233;mon. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is to stack blocks so that two matching icons are connected to one another adjacently and vanish. The player cannot rotate the two-piece blocks that fall from the top: instead, they flip the blocks around to reveal two different blocks on the opposite side. Most of the flipped blocks are linked to their originals: a fish becomes a fish skeleton, an apple becomes an apple half, etc. Sometimes they're rare bee or character face blocks instead: both are rare and are therefore difficult to clear once one appears, but two face blocks will eliminate an entire row when connected and are thus worth the hassle.[CR]The game has an endless single-player mode that only ends once the blocks reach the top of the screen. There is also a two-player mode.[CR] [CR]</plot>		<releasedate>25/11/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Access</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569872-nontan-no-issho-kuru-kuru-puzzle</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/nontan-to-issho-kurukuru-puzzle/3030-41074/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2409175-front.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/5/2/306352_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/b/a/gfs_7602_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/6/a/gfs_7602_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/d/a/gfs_7602_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/2/7/gfs_7602_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/f/7/gfs_7602_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/9/3/gfs_7602_3_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/4/3/gfs_7602_3_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/f/3/gfs_7602_3_3.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Noobow (Japan)">		<description>Noobow (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="8BBCC8BB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FNoobow%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="B571D9051E3A9F1A55533B4F43941CAE907AEDFF" size="96626" />		<title_clean>Noobow</title_clean>		<plot>Noobow is an Action game, published by Irem,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>11/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>Irem</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>22569</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569591-noobow</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/noobow/3030-44587/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22569-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/b/c/gfs_7796_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/6/c/gfs_7796_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/d/c/gfs_7796_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/c/c/gfs_7796_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/2/1/gfs_7796_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/1/gfs_7796_2_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/4/1/gfs_7796_2_3.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/1/gfs_7796_2_4.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/1/gfs_7796_2_5.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/3/1/gfs_7796_2_6.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Oddworld Adventures (USA, Europe)">		<description>Oddworld Adventures (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="6510C0E2" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FOddworld%20Adventures%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="BE3F69371B6959DAB34014CB1D3672F4F3377C3A" size="114638" />		<title_clean>Oddworld Adventures</title_clean>		<plot>In this side scroller, you play as Abe from Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.[CR]Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. [CR]Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.[CR]The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.[CR]Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Black Pearl Software</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21687</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585838-olympic-summer-games</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/olympic-summer-games</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/olympic-summer-games/3030-12273/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21687-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/4/4/46544_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443562-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443563-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-super.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443564-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443565-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-enter-your-name.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443566-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-the-opening-ceremonies.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443567-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-first-event-the-100m.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443568-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-on-your-mark-get.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443569-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-the-heat-1-results.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443570-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-the-medal-table.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443571-olympic-summer-games-game-boy-screenshot-next-event-hurdles.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Oni II -

Released in February of 1991 in North America and January 8, 1991 in Japan, Operation C was developed by Konami and published by Konami, Ultra Games, and Mattel (in varying countries). Operation C was later released in Konami's Game Boy compilation cartridge titled Konami GB Collection Vol. 1, which was released in Japan and Europe.[CR]The three versions of the game differed in a few ways. Naturally, Probotector replaced the human character with RD008, the robot from the two NES Probotector games. In the Japanese release, there was a stage select that made the first four stages accessible at any time.

It is based somewhat on Namco's earlier game Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, an Arcade and Super Famicom game released the previous year.[CR]Pac-Attack has been released on many different systems. The original version was released on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis in late 1993, closely followed by the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. An enhanced port was released on the Philips CD-i with the name Pac-Panic. It has also been released in many Namco and Pac-Man compilations, and the SNES version was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Pac-Attack Screen[CR]The object of the game is to clear rows of blocks by getting them into straight lines; however, most of the falling puzzle pieces also have ghosts attached which take up valuable space where blocks could be stored. The solution to this problem is Pac-Man himself. Every once in a while a Pac-Man piece will fall, and all the ghosts on the board will turn blue. If the Pac-Man piece is situated in an area where he can easily catch any ghosts he will remove them from the grid.[CR]The game offers a standard "Normal Mode" in which the game plays out as described above, as well as a "Puzzle" mode in which the player is given a limited number of Pac-Man to eat the various ghosts.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,7,7,8 and 8 out of ten. Mike Weigand wrote, "No, don't laugh, just try it! This game looks like nothing but once you start playing you will not be able to stop! The three games are addictive, and the two-player competition will have you and a friend playing until you drop!".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Give Up on Puzzle Mode Stage[CR]Press and hold the START and SELECT Buttons when playing any of the ''Puzzle Mode'' Stages to give up on the current Stage.

It is a re-branded version of 1993's  Fury of the Furries which didn't feature Pac-Man, but four different furry, ball-like creatures, called Tinies. The developer of Fury of the Furries, French company Atreid Concept (later Kalisto Entertainment), was also the developer of Pac-in-Time.[CR]Frustrated at Pac-Man's repeated victories over her spectral minions, the Ghost Witch warps Pac-Man through time to prevent him from interfering with her plans. Pac-Man has to make his way back through a series of worlds to stop her from taking over.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pac-Man can only complete a stage after collecting all the pellets on the level. To reach them, he has to find some or all of the power-ups: each increases his ability to move around the level or unlocks more of it to explore. These include:Rope: The rope lets Pac-Man swing across any ceiling, but Pac-Man has to be within a certain range for the rope to attach. It cannot be used horizontally: only vertically.Fireball: Pac's best weapon against the non-ghost enemies. Without it, Pac-Man won't be able to get around enemies without getting hurt, and he can only take so many hits before losing a life.Hammer: The hammer allows Pac-Man to break through certain barriers and open chests.Bubble: The bubble allows Pac-Man to swim through underwater sections, collecting whatever is under the surface. Without it, Pac-Man simply bobs on top of any body of water.[CR]In addition, Pac-Man also has to find a way to eliminate ghosts on the stage, as they will continue to hound him until he has been defeated. Ghosts can be eaten whenever Pac-Man finds a Power Pellet, but these are rare and Pac-Man must chase down the now fleeing ghosts before its effects wear off.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]At the main menu, select "Password" and enter these passwords.</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Namco Hometek Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.5</rating>		<videoid>u3qFFaHItck</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21689</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585841-pac-in-time</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pac-in-time</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pac-in-time/3030-11100/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21689-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/266639-pac-in-time-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213584-pac-in-time-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/266640-pac-in-time-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122589-pac-in-time-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-in-super-game.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122586-pac-in-time-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122587-pac-in-time-game-boy-screenshot-map-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122588-pac-in-time-game-boy-screenshot-level-briefing.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/9/4/gfs_1967_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/5/a/gfs_86861_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/8/a/gfs_86861_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/3/a/gfs_86861_1_3.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/2/a/gfs_86861_1_4.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/c/7/gfs_86861_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Pac-Man (USA)">		<description>Pac-Man (USA)</description>		<rom crc="B681E243" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPac-Man%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="A05F50D3571C0572EB0433474A99C966A67A2D1B" size="19001" />		<title_clean>Pac-Man</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gaming[CR]Originally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.[CR]The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.[CR]The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-Man[CR]The Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man[CR]The basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.[CR]Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.[CR]Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.[CR]Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.[CR]Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.[CR]When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[CR]When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.[CR]It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.[CR]Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.[CR]The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.[CR]Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Full Screen Mode[CR]At the title screen press right or left to make

The balls have a predictable path as they hop across the stage, but each will burst into smaller and harder to hit balls and in greater numbers will quickly overwhelm players.[CR]The player has a single harpoon gun that fires straight up and will damage a ball that touches any part of the chain. However, the player cannot fire again until the harpoon has hit the ceiling or one of the balls, which can put them at a disadvantage if they misfire. The player can earn power-ups that increase the number of simultaneous harpoons or allow them to stick to the ceiling for a few seconds.[CR]Pang was originally released as an Arcade game by Capcom. It was later ported to a vast number of computers and consoles. The majority of the US versions were renamed Buster Bros., including the Arcade game.

It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Mindscape</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>Rw9ME2z1eqs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18890</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585845-paperboy</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/paperboy</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/paperboy/3030-3414/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5345</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18890-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206821-paperboy-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253245-paperboy-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65237-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65238-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-your-deliveries.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65239-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-changing-from-the-road-to-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65240-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-someone-not-using-the-green-cross.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65241-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-watch-out-for-skaters.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65242-paperboy-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/d/4/gfs_38683_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/0/4/gfs_38683_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/b/4/gfs_38683_1_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/4/9/gfs_38683_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Paperboy 2 (USA, Europe)">		<description>Paperboy 2 (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="8EE404CA" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPaperboy%202%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="473D84E2BFDB2DC2615B2EA416188C62FEDB4ECF" size="94881" />		<title_clean>Paperboy 2</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Paperboy 2 is the follow up to Atari's minor Arcade hit Paperboy and features identical gameplay. The goal is to deliver papers to all the houses specified by the player's route, while occasionally scoring bonuses by "shooting" excess papers at various targets along the way. The player must also avoid all the obstacles along the street, which range from traffic to dogs to RC cars to the Grim Reaper. The game was developed specifically for early 1990s computers and consoles; unlike the first, it never began life as an Arcade game.[CR]Unlike the original Paperboy, Paperboy 2 also features a girl who delivers papers. The player must also deliver papers to houses on either side of the street, whereas in the first the player simply had the one side to consider. Achieving certain objectives during the run, like foiling a criminal mid-robbery, will put the Paperboy on the front page of the newspaper that appears at the end of the stage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard Way Password[CR]Access Hard Way[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard Way Password[CR]Access middle Road</plot>		<releasedate>1/6/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<studio>Mindscape, Tengen Inc.</studio>		<videoid>CYKk0WxExiY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21693</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585846-paperboy-2</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/paperboy-2</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/paperboy-2/3030-17563/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21693-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/146121-paperboy-2-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142187-paperboy-2-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/1/d/gfs_38684_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/c/d/gfs_38684_1_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/7/d/gfs_38684_1_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/6/d/gfs_38684_1_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/d/d/gfs_38684_1_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/0/gfs_38684_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/5/0/gfs_38684_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/0/gfs_38684_2_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/f/0/gfs_38684_2_4.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Parasol Henbee (Japan)">		<description>Parasol Henbee (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="AE97EC53" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FParasol%20Henbee%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="8F319D3D1929D953934E32CE900249ECF6B55FBD" size="41631" />		<title_clean>Parasol Henbee</title_clean>		<plot>Parasol Henbee is an Action game, developed by SAS Sakata and published by Epoch,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>16/11/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>SAS Sakata</studio>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/579859-parasol-henbee</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/2/2/31422_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/2/2/31422_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/7/e/gfs_20248_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/e/3/gfs_20248_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/3/3/gfs_20248_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/3/gfs_20248_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/9/3/gfs_20248_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/2/3/gfs_20248_2_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/f/3/gfs_20248_2_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/5/7/gfs_20248_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Parasol Stars - Rainbow Islands II (Europe)">		<description>Parasol Stars - Rainbow Islands II (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="C35AD128" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FParasol%20Stars%20-%20Rainbow%20Islands%20II%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="4970BBF5456305F2BFDB27E3A0DC14BE4A0E10B7" size="100332" />		<title_clean>Parasol Stars - Rainbow Islands II</title_clean>		<plot>This sequel to Rainbow Islands sees a return to the gameplay of Bubble Bobble, but with Bub and Bob in their now-human forms.[CR]The boys must clear a series of screens of bad guys - who take slightly more esoteric forms than the angry caterpillars from Rainbow Islands - and again pick up a whole bunch of power-ups.[CR]But this time they're armed with umbrellas!

Parodius is a side-scrolling shooter at its heart. Players use their ships to blast wave after wave of enemies, collecting powerups that range from shields to missles to, in the case of Parodius, heat-seaking octopi. A lot of characters in the game come from various Konami franchises, as well as popular characters in Japanese culture and history. It is a very deliberate send-up of Gradius, with menu options including "One Player", "Two Player" and "Lollipop", but is a very accomplished version of the series at its heart which, despite the candy-coated visuals, zany characters and far out enemies, is a great game in its own right.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the only playable character in the Gradius series is the Vic Viper fighter, Parodius' selectable characters offer a bit more variety.TwinbeeTwinbee[CR]A small blue plane with two big fists on the front, Twinbee is the eponymous main character in its own series of games, the first of which was ported to the US and renamed as Stinger. In its games, Twinbee's powerups were granted by shooting bells that appear on the screen. The bells also appear in Parodius, supplying the player with a limited set of power-ups that work independently from the standard weapon powerups gained from blowing up enemy ships. Twinbee's powerups include rocket fists, which fly across the screen and slowly return to the plane, a forwards and backwards shot, a three-way shot, shadowed out copies of twinbee that fire and cannot be damaged, and a radial shield that offers a wide area of protection.Vic ViperVic Viper[CR]The Vic Viper is just about the only normal thing about Parodius. Its powerups match those found in Gradius. Included are missles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, a laser beam, small glowing options which absorb bullets and fire when the Vic Viper fires, and a shield which blocks shots in front.TakosukeTakosuke[CR]Takosuke is a space-faring, headband-wearing octopus. He was created specifically for this game, and in a weird way fits into the game better because of it. His powerups include missles that fire straight up and down, a forwards and backwards shot, a wide-area ripple laser, little octopi that follow Takosuke around and fire when he does, and a jellyfish-shaped shield.PentarouPentarou[CR]Pentarou is a penguin, a penguin that travels through space and shoots out of his mouth and other places. His upgrades are missles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, an exploding shot, small penguins that travel close to Pentarou and shoot when he does, and a bubble shield.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Weapons[CR]With game paused, enter code to attain all weapons[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Weapons[CR]To access the music test, enter code on the Palcom/Konami/Loading screen (the screen is different depending on the version of the game)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden stage[CR]In stage 3 once you've entered the cave, fly down into the first pool of water to be taken straight to a hidden bonus stage,</plot>		<releasedate>5/4/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<videoid>d4SVHPP7fEU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>24102</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/574772-parodius</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/parodius</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/parodius/3030-810/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24102-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/21581-parodius-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/21582-parodius-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/111525-parodius-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44314-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-game-developer.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44315-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44316-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-setup-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44317-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-player-selection.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44318-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-stage-1-beginning.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44319-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-close-to-the-end-of-stage-1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44320-parodius-game-boy-screenshot-stage-1-boss.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/f/gfs_13586_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/f/gfs_13586_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/6/5/gfs_109186_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Parodius Da!

Sara was given one of her mother's eyes when she was born, and for unknown reasons needs the other eye when she reaches adulthood. With this goal in mind, she ventures forth to find her mother and fulfill the prophecy..[CR]At its core, Penta Dragon is a shooter, but some elements of games like Zelda are thrown in to spice things up a bit. Self scrolling is ditched in favor of eight directional movement, so you can back track through the levels in case you missed something. (This isn't the case in the secret levels, where you turn into a spaceship (??) and can only go up or down.)[CR]The powerup system is different from most shooters as well: There's the usual shot variations (Forward, Spread, and a Back Shot), and mega bombs that kill everything on screen, but you can also amass inventory items such as health potions, shields, and a couple of things I have no clue as to what they do.[CR]The game isn't very long per se, but you can get lost very easily in a couple of the levels. The element of exploration is fun, but when you've wandered around for 20 minutes with no clue where to go it can get aggravating, especially since you get attacked by mini-bosses at seemingly random intervals.[CR]Graphically, the game looks a lot like the SaGa games (Which I like), but the animation seems a little choppy which detracts from the action a bit. The music and sound effects are okay, but nothing to write home about.[CR]Overall, this is a pretty fun game, so if you like shooters and/or Zelda, you should get some enjoyment from it.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]The text behaves nicely and the grammar/spelling is good.[CR]Reviewer: Silver X[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/653/[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start With Lots of Items[CR]At the title screen, select "Game Start".

The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.[CR]The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.[CR]As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</plot>		<releasedate>14/4/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Simulation, Sports</genre>		<studio>Malibu Games</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.3</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>24099</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585848-pga-european-tour</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pga-european-tour</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pga-european-tour/3030-697/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24099-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443865-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443866-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-super-game.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443867-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-the-pro-shop.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443868-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-new-game-or-old-game.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443869-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-practice-tournament.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443870-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-how-many-players.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443871-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-i-choose-to-play-as.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443872-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-i-will-play-at-the-forest.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443873-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-here-is-a-map-of-the.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443874-pga-european-tour-game-boy-screenshot-teeing-off-at-hole-1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="PGA Tour 96 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>PGA Tour 96 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="6FF72043" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPGA%20Tour%2096%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="8566F5C09CCB682BBC74CADCBC9FFCC8FC349968" size="333641" />		<title_clean>PGA Tour 96</title_clean>		<plot>The handheld versions of their console brethren still features the PGA license, but is missing the pros and instead uses generic golfers.

Your goal is to reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares.  Clues along the grid's edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone.  The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.[CR]Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then eight).[CR]After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards.  You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 10th Puzzle[CR]To access the 10th puzzle in every stage, don't fail, restart, give up, use hints or disable the time limit on any previous puzzle.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret borders[CR]If you're playing Picross 2 with the Super Gameboy, you can change the color of the border if you hold a button or the control pad in a specific direction before pushing Start.

Sequel to the game Pinball Dreams and the predecessor of Pinball Illusions. It was created by Digital Illustions CE in 1992 for the Commodore Amiga, and was eventually ported to many other home computers and consoles. It also appeared in a number of pinball-related compilations and was later adapted for mobile phones and iOS by Cowboy Rodeo.[CR]The four featured tables include:Billion Dollar Gameshow: A board that is based around showy gameshows where the player must earn prizes by taking the ramps in specific orders.Party Land: An amusement park themed board. Filling up the words CRAZY or PARTY allows the player to enter a high score event.Speed Devils: This board is based on high-speed car racing. The player is in a race and must overtake other cars with the pinball.Stones 'N Bones: A haunted house-themed board featuring various modes to progress through.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>GameTek</studio>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>1.7</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21696</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585851-pinball-fantasies</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pinball-fantasies</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pinball-fantasies/3030-12347/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21696-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/8/8/39488_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298634-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-21st-century-entertainment.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298635-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-copyright-screen-on.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298636-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298637-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-1-partyland-highscores.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298638-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-2-speed-devils.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298639-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-3-billion-dollar.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298640-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-4-stones-bones.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/299455-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-1-partyland-top.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/299454-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-1-partyland-bottom.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/299457-pinball-fantasies-game-boy-screenshot-table-2-speed-devils.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Pinball Mania (Europe)">		<description>Pinball Mania (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="EDC8D122" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPinball%20Mania%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="0541161B4B93FFFC3C75708ACA86EA0873747CED" size="114776" />		<title_clean>Pinball Mania</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]After the success of Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasies and Pinball Illusions, publisher 21st Century Entertainment decided to let Spidersoft Limited develop a fourth game--Pinball Mania. Where the previous games excelled in ball simulation, a lot of people felt that Pinball Mania had very lacking ball physics, making controlled shots difficult to accomplish.[CR]A Game Boy port was also released which was only released in the UK.[CR]The Tables[CR]Tarantula[CR]Themed after its namesake, the table features a horror movie inspired soundtrack. The design of Tarantula is arguably one of the most interesting of the four tables, featuring several ramps and two extra flippers; one at the top of the table, and one mid-table.Jailbreak[CR]The theme of Jailbreak is influenced by various elements connected to criminals, police and the justice system. The music could be described as that of a suspenseful action thriller. The layout is very busy with many drop targets and arrows to light up. There are two extra flippers mid-table and it should be noted that they are reversed, meaning that the right flipper control controls the left mid-table flipper and vice versa.Kick Off[CR]As the name suggest, this table has a soccer match theme. The music is inspired by music associated with sporting events, and there are some very familiar queues throughout.The layout of Kick Off is symmetrical with one ramp on each side, and one extra flipper on each side of the middle of the table.Jackpot[CR]The Jackpot table has a casino theme, with a lounge soundtrack. This is a pretty straightforward table, with all the common elements, such as ramps, a loop, as well as an extra pair of mid-table flippers.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>1/1/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Pinball</genre>		<studio>GameTek UK Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>sA5QdZbgo0E</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>28562</thegamesdb_id>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pinball-mania_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pinball-mania/3030-16493/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28562-1.png</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/602285-pinball-mania-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/602286-pinball-mania-game-boy-screenshot-select-your-table.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/602287-pinball-mania-game-boy-screenshot-going-for-a-game-with-jailbreak.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/602288-pinball-mania-game-boy-screenshot-upper-half-of-jackpot.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Pingu -

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.[CR]Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.[CR]Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Game (Japanese Version)[CR]Enter "PIPE" as the password to start in a hidden stage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Game (Japanese Version)[CR]Enter the following codes to access the levels indicated:</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Bullet-Proof Software</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21697</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585853-pipe-dream</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pipe-dream</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pipe-dream/3030-2779/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21697-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218686-pipe-dream-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218687-pipe-dream-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298484-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-copyright-notice.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298485-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-beat-these-high.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298486-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-level-and-bgm-selection.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298487-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-gameplay-intersections-will.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298488-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-stage-summary-and-points-gained.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298489-pipe-dream-game-boy-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/0/9/gfs_3107_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/d/9/gfs_3107_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/b/4/gfs_77145_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/6/4/gfs_77145_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Pit Fighter (USA, Europe)">		<description>Pit Fighter (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="0680BFC3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPit%20Fighter%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="2A399B0524E9983FD361A98EC4B99D562361223B" size="168481" />		<title_clean>Pit Fighter</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990. Though it was widely reviled by critics for its lackluster game play and fighting style, it is notable and revolutionary for being the first fighting game to utilize blue screen-captured digitized versions of real people for use as the games characters. This would later be used by the Mortal Kombat series, among others, to greater effect.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.[CR]There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.[CR]These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO.[CR]Ports[CR]Though the arcade version of Pit-Fighter quickly became irrelevant due to the introduction of Mortal Kombat and other highly successful fighters, it was ported to many home consoles and portable devices, which included the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amistrad, SNES, Genesis, Atari Lynx, Sinclair Spectrum and Game Boy. These ports varied widely in quality, though all retained the basic characters and gameplay style that Pit-Fighter was known for.[CR]The arcade version of Pit-Fighter was also featured in a recent greatest hit compilation known as Midway Arcade Treasures 2, which was available on Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, as well as a PC-only compilation named Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited continues code[CR]When Ultimate says ''Still the best,'' enter the following code to gain unlimited continues:</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>THQ Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>0.5</rating>		<videoid>8uN-0zFgu-w</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21618</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585854-pit-fighter</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pit-fighter</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pit-fighter/3030-12530/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21618-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22276-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22277-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-fighter-selection.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22278-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-over-the-top-wrestling-move.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22279-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-celebrate.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22280-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-standoff.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/22281-pit-fighter-game-boy-screenshot-the-winner-gets-a-ride-on-a.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/9/gfs_38688_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/9/gfs_38688_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/9/gfs_38688_1_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/9/4/gfs_38688_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Pitman (Japan)">		<description>Pitman (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="A0B68136" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPitman%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="A698D4BCCD69D2CA51CB48877BDE5D1F83D4317F" size="23113" />		<title_clean>Pitman</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A puzzle game that was originally released for the Sharp MZ in 1985.

However, there are several levels where the player plays as both characters simultaneously; the player must switch back and forth between them to maneuver through the puzzle room.Each level features at least one enemy; the goal being to reach all enemies and destroy them. The enemies cannot harm the main characters, so the difficulty is in finding the correct route through the level without getting stuck.

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.[CR]Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.[CR]Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.

Your new life starts from the first day of school (April 14th) and ends when you confess your love to one of the heroines on Christmas (December 25th). At the beginning of each week, you select two activities to "work on" and "try your best at" for each day of the week. The activity selected will raise the appropriate stat (studying raises KNOWLEDGE, personal grooming raises LOOKS). By raising the right stat, it's possible to deepen the relationship with certain heroines. Most of the gameplay is watching in-game events with different results based on your current stat. On Sundays, it's possible to select where you want to go for the day, such as going to the game center or using the money you earned at your part-time for gifts. CDs of voice actresses reading the lines of the characters were released with some copies of the game, making it possible to listen to the heroines speaking instead of simply reading their lines.Heroines[CR]Ruruna Saeki[CR]Voiced by: Mariko Kouda[CR]Birthday - June 14th[CR]Blood type - A[CR]Childhood friend and in the same class as the protagonist.

Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&amp;eacute;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&amp;eacute;mon evolve. Important--no single Pok&amp;eacute;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&amp;eacute;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First go into the Safari Zone (SZ). Go into the area with the pokemon that you want(e.g. Scyther). After you're there, fly to Cinnibar Islands. Surf up &amp; down the right coast, and eventually SZ pokemon will battle you there. If you need other SZ pokemon, just keep swimming up &amp; down the coast. The effect of this glitch doesn't affect your saved game. If you get tired of swimming, don't get out of the water: instead, save right where you are. When you resume your journey, the SZ glitch will still be in effect. This glitch works with any area, not just the SZ.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get WELL 99 of an item, put the item you want duplicated in the sixth item slot. Make sure you have the Fly HM, then Fly to Viridian City. Talk to the old man that stopped you in the begining of the game( kind of to the north) When he asks if you are in a hurry, say no and watch him catch a weedle. [CR]Then Fly to Cinnabar Island, and use the SURF HM. Surf along the right COAST, Not in the water, if you surf in the water it won't work. [CR]Now, use SURF until you run into a Pokemon called ''M'', ''Missingno.'', Or a Pokemon over level 100 Once you see one of those, kill it or just simply run away. DON'T CATCH THE M OR MISSINGNO. AS IT WILL RUIN YOUR GAME!!! [CR]When fighting a high level M if you have a slow pokemon and it attacks you are screwed, as it has a VERY high attack, you can beat him by simply using a quick attack. [CR]after you win/run look at your sixth item it should look VERY weird with wird symbols and such, don't worry all it means is you have over 99 once you use it up alot it will stop using symbols and once the supply gets back to 99 it will show up as ''99'' [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]You need a link cable, 2 pokemon games, and 2 gameboys for this trick.  On 1 gameboy, have a strong pokemon that you both want.  On the other, have a weak pokemon that your willing to give up for the other one.  Enter Trade mode and trade pokemon.  On gameboy 1 (the one with the good pokemon), turn off the gameboy right before it says ''Trade Complete!''.  The 2nd GB should say ''Trade Complete!'' on it.  If done correctly, the bad pokemon on GB 2 should be deleted and replaced with the good pokemon.  The good pokemon on GB 1 should still be there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Glitch City is a weird glitchy town that you can unlock (and get to) by doing the following in this order: [CR]-Go to the Safari Zone (in Fuchia City) [CR]-Enter Safari Zone (pay the 500 bucks) [CR]-Go out of the Safari Zone and when the guy asks you if you want to leave, say ''No'' [CR]-Repeat the last step [CR]-Save your game when you are in the Safari Zone, and turn it off [CR]-Turn the game back on and leave the Safari Zone (the guy shouldn't ask you if you want to leave) [CR]-Go to Cinibar Island and surf half on land and half on water, DO this until a message pops up- ''PA-Ding-Dong, Time's Up! Your Safari game is over!'' [CR]- You will then be transported back to the Safari Zone [CR]-Exit the Safari Zone building and you will be in Glitch Town [CR][B] Congrats you did it! [/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]To get the diploma catch all 150 Pokemon and go and see Professor Oak in his lab. He will then give you the diploma.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]This trick is very simple. Find a patch of grass in there. Stand in it and just tap the directional pad lightly just so you would turn without walking.  You should encounter a pokemon and catch it if you would like.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]If you have a pokmon that needs a moonstone to evolve, you can cause it to evolve though normal battling. First make sure that the pokmon needing the moonstone to evolve is in the lead position before going into a battle. Once the battle has started, switch that pokmon with another that knows the move "Mimic". Have this pokmon continually use Mimic to defeat your opponent. If the shared experience gained from battle is enough to level up your moonstone needing pokmon, it should evolve as if a moonstone was just used on it.</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<videoid>s_4zaj8EbFI</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/2/1/821_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/2/1/821_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/b/1/gfs_4611_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/6/1/gfs_4611_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/1/gfs_68475_1_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/9/3/gfs_69555_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/4/3/gfs_69555_1_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/f/3/gfs_69555_1_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/3/gfs_69555_1_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/5/3/gfs_69555_1_5.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/2/c/gfs_4611_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/c/gfs_4611_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Pocket Puyo Puyo Tsuu (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pocket Puyo Puyo Tsuu (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="43E47A81" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPocket%20Puyo%20Puyo%20Tsuu%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="2FFBFF6706047988468A7952DE09C2720C3019ED" size="201605" />		<title_clean>Pocket Puyo Puyo Tsuu</title_clean>		<plot>Pocket Puyo Puyo Tsuu is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Compile,which was released in Japan in 1996.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Options[CR]At the main menu, highlight the Configuration mode (last option) and press A + B.

Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&amp;eacute;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&amp;eacute;mon evolve. Important--no single Pok&amp;eacute;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&amp;eacute;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road.

[CR]Then Fly to Cinnabar Island, and use the SURF HM. Surf along the right COAST, Not in the water, if you surf in the water it won't work. [CR]Now, use SURF until you run into a Pokemon called ''M'', ''Missingno.'', Or a Pokemon over level 100 Once you see one of those, kill it or just simply run away. DON'T CATCH THE M OR MISSINGNO. AS IT WILL RUIN YOUR GAME!!! [CR]When fighting a high level M if you have a slow pokemon and it attacks you are screwed, as it has a VERY high attack, you can beat him by simply using a quick attack. [CR]after you win/run look at your sixth item it should look VERY weird with wird symbols and such, don't worry all it means is you have over 99 once you use it up alot it will stop using symbols and once the supply gets back to 99 it will show up as ''99'' [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]You need a link cable, 2 pokemon games, and 2 gameboys for this trick.  On 1 gameboy, have a strong pokemon that you both want.  On the other, have a weak pokemon that your willing to give up for the other one.  Enter Trade mode and trade pokemon.  On gameboy 1 (the one with the good pokemon), turn off the gameboy right before it says ''Trade Complete!''.  The 2nd GB should say ''Trade Complete!'' on it.  If done correctly, the bad pokemon on GB 2 should be deleted and replaced with the good pokemon.  The good pokemon on GB 1 should still be there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Glitch City is a weird glitchy town that you can unlock (and get to) by doing the following in this order: [CR]-Go to the Safari Zone (in Fuchia City) [CR]-Enter Safari Zone (pay the 500 bucks) [CR]-Go out of the Safari Zone and when the guy asks you if you want to leave, say ''No'' [CR]-Repeat the last step [CR]-Save your game when you are in the Safari Zone, and turn it off [CR]-Turn the game back on and leave the Safari Zone (the guy shouldn't ask you if you want to leave) [CR]-Go to Cinibar Island and surf half on land and half on water, DO this until a message pops up- ''PA-Ding-Dong, Time's Up! Your Safari game is over!'' [CR]- You will then be transported back to the Safari Zone [CR]-Exit the Safari Zone building and you will be in Glitch Town [CR][B] Congrats you did it! [/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]To get the diploma catch all 150 Pokemon and go and see Professor Oak in his lab. He will then give you the diploma.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]This trick is very simple. Find a patch of grass in there. Stand in it and just tap the directional pad lightly just so you would turn without walking.  You should encounter a pokemon and catch it if you would like.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]If you have a pokmon that needs a moonstone to evolve, you can cause it to evolve though normal battling. First make sure that the pokmon needing the moonstone to evolve is in the lead position before going into a battle. Once the battle has started, switch that pokmon with another that knows the move "Mimic". Have this pokmon continually use Mimic to defeat your opponent. If the shared experience gained from battle is enough to level up your moonstone needing pokmon, it should evolve as if a moonstone was just used on it.</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>s_4zaj8EbFI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2357</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-blue-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6678</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2357-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2357-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23702-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56861-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254330-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2357-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177449-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-on-super.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177450-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-the-beginning-of.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177451-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-wandering-around.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177452-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-charmander-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177453-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-bulbasaur-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177454-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-squirtle-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177455-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-childhood-rival.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177456-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-appear-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177457-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-pokemon-center.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-8.jpg</fanart8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/csE6YGu.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Blue Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Blue Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="D6DA8A1A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Blue%20Version%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="D7037C83E1AE5B39BDE3C30787637BA1D4C48CE2" size="378365" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Blue Version</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&amp;eacute;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&amp;eacute;mon evolve. Important--no single Pok&amp;eacute;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&amp;eacute;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First go into the Safari Zone (SZ). Go into the area with the pokemon that you want(e.g. Scyther). After you're there, fly to Cinnibar Islands. Surf up &amp; down the right coast, and eventually SZ pokemon will battle you there. If you need other SZ pokemon, just keep swimming up &amp; down the coast. The effect of this glitch doesn't affect your saved game. If you get tired of swimming, don't get out of the water: instead, save right where you are. When you resume your journey, the SZ glitch will still be in effect. This glitch works with any area, not just the SZ.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get WELL 99 of an item, put the item you want duplicated in the sixth item slot. Make sure you have the Fly HM, then Fly to Viridian City. Talk to the old man that stopped you in the begining of the game( kind of to the north) When he asks if you are in a hurry, say no and watch him catch a weedle. [CR]Then Fly to Cinnabar Island, and use the SURF HM. Surf along the right COAST, Not in the water, if you surf in the water it won't work. [CR]Now, use SURF until you run into a Pokemon called ''M'', ''Missingno.'', Or a Pokemon over level 100 Once you see one of those, kill it or just simply run away. DON'T CATCH THE M OR MISSINGNO. AS IT WILL RUIN YOUR GAME!!! [CR]When fighting a high level M if you have a slow pokemon and it attacks you are screwed, as it has a VERY high attack, you can beat him by simply using a quick attack. [CR]after you win/run look at your sixth item it should look VERY weird with wird symbols and such, don't worry all it means is you have over 99 once you use it up alot it will stop using symbols and once the supply gets back to 99 it will show up as ''99'' [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]You need a link cable, 2 pokemon games, and 2 gameboys for this trick.

You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]To get the diploma catch all 150 Pokemon and go and see Professor Oak in his lab. He will then give you the diploma.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]This trick is very simple. Find a patch of grass in there. Stand in it and just tap the directional pad lightly just so you would turn without walking.  You should encounter a pokemon and catch it if you would like.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]If you have a pokmon that needs a moonstone to evolve, you can cause it to evolve though normal battling. First make sure that the pokmon needing the moonstone to evolve is in the lead position before going into a battle. Once the battle has started, switch that pokmon with another that knows the move "Mimic". Have this pokmon continually use Mimic to defeat your opponent. If the shared experience gained from battle is enough to level up your moonstone needing pokmon, it should evolve as if a moonstone was just used on it.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Nintendo</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>6lBqaQuKAVQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2357</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-blue-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6678</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://i.imgur.com/mqOoVY7.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/uhMeHQ8.png</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23702-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56861-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254330-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2357-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177449-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-on-super.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177450-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-the-beginning-of.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177451-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-wandering-around.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177452-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-charmander-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177453-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-bulbasaur-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177454-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-squirtle-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177455-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-childhood-rival.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177456-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-appear-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177457-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-pokemon-center.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-8.jpg</fanart8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/csE6YGu.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Edicion Amarilla - Edicion Especial Pikachu (Spain) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Edicion Amarilla - Edicion Especial Pikachu (Spain) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="964B7A10" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Edicion%20Amarilla%20-%20Edicion%20Especial%20Pikachu%20%28Spain%29%20%28GBC%2CSGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="1DC242039218FBA50928D1AFB66B70565B6B9DAF" size="511707" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Edicion Amarilla - Edicion Especial Pikachu</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer's license, and now you're on your way to becoming the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer!The shockingly cute Pikachu tags along behind you as you search the enormous world for monsters to train and evolve.Face off against Blastoise's torrential water gun.Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy gust.Develop the ultimate Pok&#233;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM leaders and become the greatest Pok&#233;mon master of all time![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, assure no save file exists on your game; if it does, hold Up, Select, and B at the title screen and clear the file. Start a new game and do the usual introduction, but choose "ASH" for your name and "BLUE" for your rival's. When given control, walk downstairs in your house to the tile north of the eastern tile of the entrance mat. Open the menu and then save the game. When you select "YES", very quickly thereafter (the timing can take several tries), turn off the console mid-save. (The timing is between the text box with "YES"/"NO" disappearing and the save confirmation message changing.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done right, you can access your file and go into the Pokemon menu, but it's blank and extended beyond 6 Pokemon. Grab a Pokemon between slots 1-9 (those immediately on-screen) and swap it with slot 10's Pokemon. Take slot 11 and switch it with slot 9. Go to your Items menu next, and hold Down until the cursor stops flashing. Hit A and glitch the menu, then hit Down, A, Down, A in that order. Now look down the list for a Master Ball. Go down one more item and press Select. Scroll down until you see another Master Ball, and press Select to swap it with the item you grabbed. Now, toss 68 of that item. Exit the menu and then exit your house to walk straight into the Hall of Fame! You'll get the game completion scene as normal, and often have more than 150 Pokemon in your Pokedex![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have ABRA in your party. Go up Nugget bridge in Cerulean City and to the left to the trainer facing north.  Stand right to his left and make sure he doesn't see you. Head north until he is off screen.  Go one step east. Step south and pause the game before he has a ! over his head. Use teleport. Fight the first trainer in Cerulean gym and use Growl 6 times.  Kill his Pokemon and go back to Nugget Bridge. The game will pause automatically. Press B to find a level 1 Mew.  Catch it and put it at the front of your party. Go in tall grass, find a wild Pokemon, and switch Mew with a different Pokemon. Kill the wild Pokemon. Mew will level up to 100. Do this glitch again with the trainer facing north on the route to Bill's house to get another level 100 Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you first start your game, you will have 1 potion in your pc that's in your room. Get it out. Continue playing the game untill you get Pikachu but haven't battled Gary's Eevee yet. Use the potion on Pikachu 5 times (even though it won't have any effect). Fight Gary and WIN. After the battle, when your Pikachu comes out of the Pokeball. He will like you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get the Diploma[CR]Complete your Pokedex (Mew is optional) and visit the game designer in the Celadon Mansion. He will give you a diploma as a reward.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Once you've obtained the HM Cut you can use it to teach some of your pokemon the attack of the same name.[CR]This ability now cannot only be used to cut down certain trees but also to get rid of any grass so you don't have to bother with any random encounters.[CR]When saving and loading or leaving and reentering the area you used cut in, the grass will have returned.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Use the Pikachu from your Pokemon Yellow in every match in the Tournament mode of Pokemon Stadium. Pikachu should learn Surf. Now go south of Fuschia City and into the house at the beach. Talk to the man inside. Make sure Pikachu is in your party. You should be able to play a mini-game.</plot>		<releasedate>19/10/1999</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.2</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QofMrP7aOLY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2359</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/198314-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-yellow-special-pikachu-edition/3030-18673/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2359-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2359-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36287-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35554-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30298-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69878-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/118838-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202438-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2359-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606620-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606621-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88927-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88928-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88929-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88930-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88931-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88932-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88933-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-8.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-9.jpg</fanart9>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2359-g.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2359.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Edicion Azul (Spain) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Edicion Azul (Spain) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="D95416F9" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Edicion%20Azul%20%28Spain%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="7715E7B133E8634DF48918B9138374110212A108" size="380999" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Edicion Azul</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer's license.

Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center.

When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City. He will then give you the diploma.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QghgrmYhGK4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2357</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/367023-pokemon-red-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6679</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2357-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2357-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30875-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64395-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114314-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153015-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254333-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2357-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59851-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-journey-begins.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59852-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-and-it-ends-very-quickly.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59853-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-danger-ahead-fat-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59854-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-can-t-go-that-way-neither.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59855-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-john-wants-to-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59856-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-that-will-teach-him.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59857-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-status.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59858-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-status.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/356897-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-wild-battle.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-8.jpg</fanart8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SzH2aIQ.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Edicion Roja (Spain) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Edicion Roja (Spain) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="D8507D8A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Edicion%20Roja%20%28Spain%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="FC17C5B904D551B1B908054CCD1C493F755F832A" size="381227" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Edicion Roja</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&#233;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&#233;mon evolve. Important - no single Pok&#233;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&#233;mon strategy to defeat the 8 GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&#233;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Simply attempt to put your bike into the computer at any Pokemon Center. Instead of going in, you will have one in your bag and one in your computer as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]**THIS GLITCH CAN DELETE YOUR GAME SAVE DATA.**  [CR]**This glitch requires 2 Gameboys and a link cable.**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have one Pokemon game with a pokemon that you both want (generally a starting pokemon, a legendary, or Mewtwo).  Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City. He will then give you the diploma.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>WP4R-wVeT9s</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2356</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/367023-pokemon-red-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6679</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2356-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2356-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30875-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64395-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114314-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153015-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254333-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2356-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59851-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-journey-begins.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59852-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-and-it-ends-very-quickly.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59853-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-danger-ahead-fat-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59854-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-can-t-go-that-way-neither.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59855-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-john-wants-to-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59856-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-that-will-teach-him.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59857-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-status.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59858-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-status.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/356897-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-wild-battle.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-10.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-2.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-3.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-4.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-5.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-6.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-7.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-8.jpg</fanart9>		<fanart10>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-9.jpg</fanart10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SzH2aIQ.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2356.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Gelbe Edition - Special Pikachu Edition (Germany) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Gelbe Edition - Special Pikachu Edition (Germany) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="7A01E45A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Gelbe%20Edition%20-%20Special%20Pikachu%20Edition%20%28Germany%29%20%28GBC%2CSGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="42F3714EEC6ECA25200D42461FF08D57C98F6D1D" size="516746" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Gelbe Edition - Special Pikachu Edition</title_clean>		<plot>You&#8217;ve finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer&#8217;s license, and now you&#8217;re on your way to becoming the world&#8217;s greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer!

Now, it's time to head out to become the world greatest Pok?mon trainer. Starting with just one Pok?mon, you need to train hard and vigorously to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four.[CR]You start out in a simple town with just one Pok?mon. With that Pok?mon, it's up to you to battle and catch 5 other Pok?mon and train them to become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There are 150 Pok?mon to catch, and along the way you can teach your Pok?mon new moves, so every Pok?mon is different and unique. Because of this, no Pok?mon is the best. You need to maintain a well-balanced team of six Pok?mon to defeat any challenge that you face. But remember, there are always other trainers out there willing to prove that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle it out with other trainers as well as the Gym Leaders.[CR]Not only that, but Pok?mon Red allows you to interact with other Pok?mon owners. Find a friend with Pok?mon Red, Pok?mon Blue or Pok?mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one another. You can trade your creatures with each other, because neither Red nor Blue has all 150 Pok?mon. Interaction is essential to becoming a Pok?mon master![CR]It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok?mon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and become the greatest Pok?mon Master of all time?[CR]Pok?mon Red differentiates itself from Pok?mon Blue in that there are different Pok?mon in each game. Common Pok?mon in Red are uncommon in Blue, and those in Blue may not even show up in Red. It requires both games to collect all 150 Pok?mon and become a Pok?mon master.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Simply attempt to put your bike into the computer at any Pokemon Center. Instead of going in, you will have one in your bag and one in your computer as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]**THIS GLITCH CAN DELETE YOUR GAME SAVE DATA.**  [CR]**This glitch requires 2 Gameboys and a link cable.**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have one Pokemon game with a pokemon that you both want (generally a starting pokemon, a legendary, or Mewtwo).  Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City. He will then give you the diploma.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Nintendo</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.9</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QghgrmYhGK4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2356</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/367023-pokemon-red-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6679</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2356-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2356-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30875-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64395-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114314-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153015-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254333-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2356-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59851-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-journey-begins.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59852-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-and-it-ends-very-quickly.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59853-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-danger-ahead-fat-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59854-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-can-t-go-that-way-neither.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59855-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-john-wants-to-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59856-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-that-will-teach-him.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59857-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-status.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59858-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-status.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/356897-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-wild-battle.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-10.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-2.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-3.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-4.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-5.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-6.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-7.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-8.jpg</fanart9>		<fanart10>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-9.jpg</fanart10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SzH2aIQ.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2356.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Rote Edition (Germany) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Rote Edition (Germany) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="89197825" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Rote%20Edition%20%28Germany%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="87D523FE1A0C548DB7C5477B451DDEC1EB083C06" size="385515" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Rote Edition</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok?mon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world greatest Pok?mon trainer. Starting with just one Pok?mon, you need to train hard and vigorously to defeat all 8 gym leaders and the Elite Four.[CR]You start out in a simple town with just one Pok?mon. With that Pok?mon, it's up to you to battle and catch 5 other Pok?mon and train them to become strong enough to defeat your rivals. There are 150 Pok?mon to catch, and along the way you can teach your Pok?mon new moves, so every Pok?mon is different and unique. Because of this, no Pok?mon is the best. You need to maintain a well-balanced team of six Pok?mon to defeat any challenge that you face. But remember, there are always other trainers out there willing to prove that they can beat you, so be prepared to battle it out with other trainers as well as the Gym Leaders.[CR]Not only that, but Pok?mon Red allows you to interact with other Pok?mon owners. Find a friend with Pok?mon Red, Pok?mon Blue or Pok?mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition battle it out with one another. You can trade your creatures with each other, because neither Red nor Blue has all 150 Pok?mon. Interaction is essential to becoming a Pok?mon master![CR]It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok?mon in this enormous world. Catch them, battle them, trade them. Can you develop the ultimate strategy to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and become the greatest Pok?mon Master of all time?[CR]Pok?mon Red differentiates itself from Pok?mon Blue in that there are different Pok?mon in each game. Common Pok?mon in Red are uncommon in Blue, and those in Blue may not even show up in Red. It requires both games to collect all 150 Pok?mon and become a Pok?mon master.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Simply attempt to put your bike into the computer at any Pokemon Center. Instead of going in, you will have one in your bag and one in your computer as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]**THIS GLITCH CAN DELETE YOUR GAME SAVE DATA.**  [CR]**This glitch requires 2 Gameboys and a link cable.**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have one Pokemon game with a pokemon that you both want (generally a starting pokemon, a legendary, or Mewtwo).  Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City. He will then give you the diploma.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>WP4R-wVeT9s</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2356</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/367023-pokemon-red-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6679</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2356-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2356-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30875-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64395-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114314-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153015-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254333-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2356-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59851-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-journey-begins.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59852-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-and-it-ends-very-quickly.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59853-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-danger-ahead-fat-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59854-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-can-t-go-that-way-neither.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59855-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-john-wants-to-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59856-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-that-will-teach-him.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59857-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-status.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59858-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-status.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/356897-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-wild-battle.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-10.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-2.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-3.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-4.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-5.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-6.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-7.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-8.jpg</fanart9>		<fanart10>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-9.jpg</fanart10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SzH2aIQ.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2356.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Version Bleue (France) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Version Bleue (France) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="50E2FC1D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Version%20Bleue%20%28France%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="47FAA910D0E073C600665BF9C83B6BD17BABDF8A" size="381088" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Version Bleue</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&amp;eacute;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&amp;eacute;mon evolve. Important--no single Pok&amp;eacute;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&amp;eacute;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First go into the Safari Zone (SZ). Go into the area with the pokemon that you want(e.g. Scyther). After you're there, fly to Cinnibar Islands. Surf up &amp; down the right coast, and eventually SZ pokemon will battle you there. If you need other SZ pokemon, just keep swimming up &amp; down the coast. The effect of this glitch doesn't affect your saved game. If you get tired of swimming, don't get out of the water: instead, save right where you are. When you resume your journey, the SZ glitch will still be in effect. This glitch works with any area, not just the SZ.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get WELL 99 of an item, put the item you want duplicated in the sixth item slot. Make sure you have the Fly HM, then Fly to Viridian City. Talk to the old man that stopped you in the begining of the game( kind of to the north) When he asks if you are in a hurry, say no and watch him catch a weedle. [CR]Then Fly to Cinnabar Island, and use the SURF HM. Surf along the right COAST, Not in the water, if you surf in the water it won't work. [CR]Now, use SURF until you run into a Pokemon called ''M'', ''Missingno.'', Or a Pokemon over level 100 Once you see one of those, kill it or just simply run away. DON'T CATCH THE M OR MISSINGNO. AS IT WILL RUIN YOUR GAME!!! [CR]When fighting a high level M if you have a slow pokemon and it attacks you are screwed, as it has a VERY high attack, you can beat him by simply using a quick attack. [CR]after you win/run look at your sixth item it should look VERY weird with wird symbols and such, don't worry all it means is you have over 99 once you use it up alot it will stop using symbols and once the supply gets back to 99 it will show up as ''99'' [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]You need a link cable, 2 pokemon games, and 2 gameboys for this trick.  On 1 gameboy, have a strong pokemon that you both want.  On the other, have a weak pokemon that your willing to give up for the other one.  Enter Trade mode and trade pokemon.  On gameboy 1 (the one with the good pokemon), turn off the gameboy right before it says ''Trade Complete!''.  The 2nd GB should say ''Trade Complete!'' on it.  If done correctly, the bad pokemon on GB 2 should be deleted and replaced with the good pokemon.  The good pokemon on GB 1 should still be there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Glitch City is a weird glitchy town that you can unlock (and get to) by doing the following in this order: [CR]-Go to the Safari Zone (in Fuchia City) [CR]-Enter Safari Zone (pay the 500 bucks) [CR]-Go out of the Safari Zone and when the guy asks you if you want to leave, say ''No'' [CR]-Repeat the last step [CR]-Save your game when you are in the Safari Zone, and turn it off [CR]-Turn the game back on and leave the Safari Zone (the guy shouldn't ask you if you want to leave) [CR]-Go to Cinibar Island and surf half on land and half on water, DO this until a message pops up- ''PA-Ding-Dong, Time's Up! Your Safari game is over!'' [CR]- You will then be transported back to the Safari Zone [CR]-Exit the Safari Zone building and you will be in Glitch Town [CR][B] Congrats you did it! [/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move.

[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]To get the diploma catch all 150 Pokemon and go and see Professor Oak in his lab. He will then give you the diploma.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]This trick is very simple. Find a patch of grass in there. Stand in it and just tap the directional pad lightly just so you would turn without walking.  You should encounter a pokemon and catch it if you would like.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]If you have a pokmon that needs a moonstone to evolve, you can cause it to evolve though normal battling. First make sure that the pokmon needing the moonstone to evolve is in the lead position before going into a battle. Once the battle has started, switch that pokmon with another that knows the move "Mimic". Have this pokmon continually use Mimic to defeat your opponent. If the shared experience gained from battle is enough to level up your moonstone needing pokmon, it should evolve as if a moonstone was just used on it.</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>s_4zaj8EbFI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2357</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-blue-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9519</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2357-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2357-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23702-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56861-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254330-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2357-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177449-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-on-super.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177450-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-the-beginning-of.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177451-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-wandering-around.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177452-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-charmander-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177453-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-bulbasaur-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177454-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-squirtle-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177455-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-childhood-rival.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177456-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-appear-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177457-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-pokemon-center.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-8.jpg</fanart8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/tQ15n0z.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Version Jaune - Edition Speciale Pikachu (France) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Version Jaune - Edition Speciale Pikachu (France) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="D03426E9" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Version%20Jaune%20-%20Edition%20Speciale%20Pikachu%20%28France%29%20%28GBC%2CSGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="0ACEEC0EF7AA2CA5AA831554598D91F61A925591" size="511656" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Version Jaune - Edition Speciale Pikachu</title_clean>		<plot>You&#8217;ve finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer&#8217;s license, and now you&#8217;re on your way to becoming the world&#8217;s greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer!

Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&#233;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&#233;mon evolve. Important - no single Pok&#233;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&#233;mon strategy to defeat the 8 GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&#233;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Simply attempt to put your bike into the computer at any Pokemon Center. Instead of going in, you will have one in your bag and one in your computer as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]**THIS GLITCH CAN DELETE YOUR GAME SAVE DATA.**  [CR]**This glitch requires 2 Gameboys and a link cable.**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have one Pokemon game with a pokemon that you both want (generally a starting pokemon, a legendary, or Mewtwo).  Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City.

Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&amp;eacute;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&amp;eacute;mon evolve. Important--no single Pok&amp;eacute;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&amp;eacute;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&amp;eacute;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First go into the Safari Zone (SZ). Go into the area with the pokemon that you want(e.g. Scyther). After you're there, fly to Cinnibar Islands. Surf up &amp; down the right coast, and eventually SZ pokemon will battle you there. If you need other SZ pokemon, just keep swimming up &amp; down the coast. The effect of this glitch doesn't affect your saved game. If you get tired of swimming, don't get out of the water: instead, save right where you are. When you resume your journey, the SZ glitch will still be in effect. This glitch works with any area, not just the SZ.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get WELL 99 of an item, put the item you want duplicated in the sixth item slot. Make sure you have the Fly HM, then Fly to Viridian City. Talk to the old man that stopped you in the begining of the game( kind of to the north) When he asks if you are in a hurry, say no and watch him catch a weedle. [CR]Then Fly to Cinnabar Island, and use the SURF HM. Surf along the right COAST, Not in the water, if you surf in the water it won't work. [CR]Now, use SURF until you run into a Pokemon called ''M'', ''Missingno.'', Or a Pokemon over level 100 Once you see one of those, kill it or just simply run away. DON'T CATCH THE M OR MISSINGNO. AS IT WILL RUIN YOUR GAME!!! [CR]When fighting a high level M if you have a slow pokemon and it attacks you are screwed, as it has a VERY high attack, you can beat him by simply using a quick attack. [CR]after you win/run look at your sixth item it should look VERY weird with wird symbols and such, don't worry all it means is you have over 99 once you use it up alot it will stop using symbols and once the supply gets back to 99 it will show up as ''99'' [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]You need a link cable, 2 pokemon games, and 2 gameboys for this trick.  On 1 gameboy, have a strong pokemon that you both want.  On the other, have a weak pokemon that your willing to give up for the other one.  Enter Trade mode and trade pokemon.  On gameboy 1 (the one with the good pokemon), turn off the gameboy right before it says ''Trade Complete!''.  The 2nd GB should say ''Trade Complete!'' on it.  If done correctly, the bad pokemon on GB 2 should be deleted and replaced with the good pokemon.  The good pokemon on GB 1 should still be there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Glitch City is a weird glitchy town that you can unlock (and get to) by doing the following in this order: [CR]-Go to the Safari Zone (in Fuchia City) [CR]-Enter Safari Zone (pay the 500 bucks) [CR]-Go out of the Safari Zone and when the guy asks you if you want to leave, say ''No'' [CR]-Repeat the last step [CR]-Save your game when you are in the Safari Zone, and turn it off [CR]-Turn the game back on and leave the Safari Zone (the guy shouldn't ask you if you want to leave) [CR]-Go to Cinibar Island and surf half on land and half on water, DO this until a message pops up- ''PA-Ding-Dong, Time's Up! Your Safari game is over!'' [CR]- You will then be transported back to the Safari Zone [CR]-Exit the Safari Zone building and you will be in Glitch Town [CR][B] Congrats you did it! [/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]To get the diploma catch all 150 Pokemon and go and see Professor Oak in his lab. He will then give you the diploma.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]This trick is very simple. Find a patch of grass in there. Stand in it and just tap the directional pad lightly just so you would turn without walking.  You should encounter a pokemon and catch it if you would like.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a diploma[CR]If you have a pokmon that needs a moonstone to evolve, you can cause it to evolve though normal battling. First make sure that the pokmon needing the moonstone to evolve is in the lead position before going into a battle. Once the battle has started, switch that pokmon with another that knows the move "Mimic". Have this pokmon continually use Mimic to defeat your opponent. If the shared experience gained from battle is enough to level up your moonstone needing pokmon, it should evolve as if a moonstone was just used on it.</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>s_4zaj8EbFI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2357</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/907714-pokemon-blue-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-blue-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6678</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2357-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2357-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23702-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56861-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254330-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2357-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177449-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-on-super.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177450-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-the-beginning-of.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177451-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-wandering-around.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177452-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-charmander-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177453-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-bulbasaur-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177454-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-squirtle-s-pokedex.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177455-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-childhood-rival.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177456-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-appear-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177457-pokemon-blue-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-pokemon-center.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2357-8.jpg</fanart8>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/csE6YGu.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Versione Gialla - Speciale Edizione Pikachu (Italy) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Versione Gialla - Speciale Edizione Pikachu (Italy) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="8B56FE33" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Versione%20Gialla%20-%20Speciale%20Edizione%20Pikachu%20%28Italy%29%20%28GBC%2CSGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="05BB8E99F24D498613930949730AFA8024E77D08" size="509392" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Versione Gialla - Speciale Edizione Pikachu</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer's license, and now you're on your way to becoming the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer!The shockingly cute Pikachu tags along behind you as you search the enormous world for monsters to train and evolve.Face off against Blastoise's torrential water gun.Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy gust.Develop the ultimate Pok&#233;mon strategy to defeat the eight GYM leaders and become the greatest Pok&#233;mon master of all time![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, assure no save file exists on your game; if it does, hold Up, Select, and B at the title screen and clear the file. Start a new game and do the usual introduction, but choose "ASH" for your name and "BLUE" for your rival's. When given control, walk downstairs in your house to the tile north of the eastern tile of the entrance mat. Open the menu and then save the game. When you select "YES", very quickly thereafter (the timing can take several tries), turn off the console mid-save. (The timing is between the text box with "YES"/"NO" disappearing and the save confirmation message changing.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done right, you can access your file and go into the Pokemon menu, but it's blank and extended beyond 6 Pokemon. Grab a Pokemon between slots 1-9 (those immediately on-screen) and swap it with slot 10's Pokemon. Take slot 11 and switch it with slot 9. Go to your Items menu next, and hold Down until the cursor stops flashing. Hit A and glitch the menu, then hit Down, A, Down, A in that order. Now look down the list for a Master Ball. Go down one more item and press Select. Scroll down until you see another Master Ball, and press Select to swap it with the item you grabbed. Now, toss 68 of that item. Exit the menu and then exit your house to walk straight into the Hall of Fame! You'll get the game completion scene as normal, and often have more than 150 Pokemon in your Pokedex![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have ABRA in your party. Go up Nugget bridge in Cerulean City and to the left to the trainer facing north.  Stand right to his left and make sure he doesn't see you. Head north until he is off screen.  Go one step east. Step south and pause the game before he has a ! over his head. Use teleport. Fight the first trainer in Cerulean gym and use Growl 6 times.  Kill his Pokemon and go back to Nugget Bridge. The game will pause automatically. Press B to find a level 1 Mew.  Catch it and put it at the front of your party. Go in tall grass, find a wild Pokemon, and switch Mew with a different Pokemon. Kill the wild Pokemon. Mew will level up to 100. Do this glitch again with the trainer facing north on the route to Bill's house to get another level 100 Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you first start your game, you will have 1 potion in your pc that's in your room. Get it out. Continue playing the game untill you get Pikachu but haven't battled Gary's Eevee yet. Use the potion on Pikachu 5 times (even though it won't have any effect). Fight Gary and WIN. After the battle, when your Pikachu comes out of the Pokeball. He will like you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get the Diploma[CR]Complete your Pokedex (Mew is optional) and visit the game designer in the Celadon Mansion. He will give you a diploma as a reward.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Once you've obtained the HM Cut you can use it to teach some of your pokemon the attack of the same name.[CR]This ability now cannot only be used to cut down certain trees but also to get rid of any grass so you don't have to bother with any random encounters.[CR]When saving and loading or leaving and reentering the area you used cut in, the grass will have returned.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Use the Pikachu from your Pokemon Yellow in every match in the Tournament mode of Pokemon Stadium. Pikachu should learn Surf. Now go south of Fuschia City and into the house at the beach. Talk to the man inside. Make sure Pikachu is in your party. You should be able to play a mini-game.</plot>		<releasedate>19/10/1999</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>8.2</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QofMrP7aOLY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2359</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/198314-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-yellow-special-pikachu-edition/3030-18673/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2359-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2359-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36287-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35554-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30298-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69878-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/118838-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202438-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2359-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606620-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606621-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88927-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88928-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88929-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88930-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88931-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88932-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88933-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-8.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-9.jpg</fanart9>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2359-g.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2359.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Versione Rossa (Italy) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Versione Rossa (Italy) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="2945ACEB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Versione%20Rossa%20%28Italy%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="65B97CF8F2F1CFF711A6D08C6C894C8CE65CE522" size="379408" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Versione Rossa</title_clean>		<plot>You've finally been granted your Pok&#233;mon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pok&#233;mon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pok&#233;mon evolve. Important - no single Pok&#233;mon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pok&#233;mon strategy to defeat the 8 GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pok&#233;mon Master of all time?[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Simply attempt to put your bike into the computer at any Pokemon Center. Instead of going in, you will have one in your bag and one in your computer as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]**THIS GLITCH CAN DELETE YOUR GAME SAVE DATA.**  [CR]**This glitch requires 2 Gameboys and a link cable.**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have one Pokemon game with a pokemon that you both want (generally a starting pokemon, a legendary, or Mewtwo).  Have the other game have a pokemon that you wouldn't miss, as it will be deleted forever (Example: Level 4 Ratatta).  Once you both have your pokemon, enter a trade.  Now, trade the bad pokemon for the good pokemon, and at the end of the trade, right after the screen flashes &amp;quot;Waiting...&amp;quot; but before it flashes &amp;quot;Trade Completed,&amp;quot; the person who originally owned the good pokemon should turn off their Gameboy or pull out the link cable (turning off the power is the preferred method, but should work).  The person who originally had the bad Pokemon should have the message &amp;quot;Trade Completed&amp;quot; on their screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done correctly, you will both now have the good pokemon.  The person who originally had it turned off their Gameboy before it could save, so his gamepak doesn't know the trade ever took place.  The second person's Gameboy remembers the trade, and has the new Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To execute this glitch properly, you need a Pokemon who evolves via a Stone (Fire Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone, Thunderstone). This only works with Pokemon whose internal ID number is equal to that of the item used to evolve it. So long as you send out such a Pokemon as your lead in the battle, and defeat the foe with a different Pokemon, this can be done. What Pokemon you switch to is important, as noted later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, send out the Stone-needing Pokemon as your lead. On the first turn, switch him out for the Pokemon that you do not want to evolve: doesn't matter which. When the Pokemon beats your foe, if the shared EXP. makes the Stone-needing Pokemon level-up, the same Pokemon will evolve. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This list describes who you must switch to for this to work: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]- If you need a Thunderstone evolution, win the battle with Growlithe. [CR]- If you need a Moon Stone evolution, win the battle with Exeggutor. [CR]- If you need a Water Stone evolution, win the battle with Onix. [CR]- If you need a Leaf Stone evolution, win the battle with Psyduck. [CR]- If you need a Fire Stone evolution, you must win the battle with a Missingno. whose internal decimal index number is 32, which is impossible to get without the use of other glitches.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Item's needed for glitch:[CR]Pokemon Red[CR]Master Ball (infinite is recommended)[CR]Rare Candy[CR]---[CR]This can only be done on Red Version of Pokemon. Do the steps described for infinite items. When you encounter the bar shaped thing (also refered to as Missing No.), use a master ball (if you have infinite) and capture the Missing No.. WARNING: Only do this is if Missing No. is at level 80. Level 0 Missing No. WILL lock your game up. It will say that you captured #### n' #### as it's name will look in the screen. For some reason it will continue to attack. Just run. If you can't, keep trying until you do. Get Missing No. into your party and give it a Rare Candy. It will move to Level 81 and say that it is evolving. I t evolves into... TAA-DAA!! Kangaskhan! This is no ordinary Kangaskhan. It has three attacks; Water Gun, Water Gun (again), and Sky Attack. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note that this glitch only works in the Japanese versions of Pokemon Red and Green Versions, Pocket Monsters Aka and Pocket Monsters Midori, respectively. It can only be executed early in the game (as in, it requires a new game), but will get you to the Hall of Fame and the ending in only around fifteen minutes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After starting a new game, take a Potion from the PC and play the game as normal until you obtain Oak's Parcel from the PokeMart in Viridian City. On the way back to Pallet Town, get into a battle. Enter the items menu and hover over the Oak's Parcel item there and press Select. Then exit the menu and go to the Pokemon menu. Press Select while hovering over your Pokemon. While it doesn't truly switch your Pokemon with an item, it effectively switches around various amounts of data in the game, allowing you to warp to places based on how many steps you take before going through a doorway. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After running from this battle, go 73 steps, the last going through the door of the northeast house in Pallet Town. You will reappear on Route 16: go right five steps and down until you warp. You will be in the hidden part of the Cycling Road gatehouse: there, walk nine steps, with the last going through the northeastern doorway. After, go 45 steps east, the last of which you need to put going through the doorway to the Celadon Department Store. You will be in the glitched version of the Hall of Fame, and then the game will play the ending sequence as if you had won the Pokemon League championship, thus allowing you to see the end of the game far earlier than is normal.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To Re-board the S.S. Anne, have a Pokemon that knows Surf with you. Go to the guy who says "the ship set sail". You'll be diagnall from him. now go in front of him and save. Turn your GB off and back on. Use your SURF Pokemon and hold DOWN. You'll be SURFing on the guy. Press DOWN the after SURFing, and you should be in the ship.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]1) Go to the Safari Zone and wander around until you run into one of the more rare and hard to catch pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]2) Run away from it and immediately use dig, teleport, escape rope, fly, or anything else that will take you immediately out of the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]3) Surf down to the Seafoam Islands from Fushia City (Use repel if you got it to avoid encounters)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]4) Surf up and down the East Coast of Seafoam. (Make sure you stay on the very edge so you are half on land half in the water)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]5) Your first pokemon encounter should be the pokemon you last saw in the Safari Zone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]I highly recommend using the infinite item glitch to get loads of master balls first so you don't risk killing your quarry.... or worse being killed by it. Very nice little trick, that will save some serious annoyance when trying to catch Pokemon like Tauros and Ryhorn who just don't want to seem to want to stay in the safari balls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The top floor of the Pokemon tower is blocked by the ghost of a Marowak, which can't be identified and defeated until you get the Silph Scope in Team Rocket's Hideout. Or apparently not, because if you use a Poke Doll item in this fight, with the Silph Scope or not, you'll escape the battle and Marowak will be defeated! With this trick, you can get to the top floor and save Mr. Fuji and get the Poke Flute without ever going into Team Rocket's hideout. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This obviously can only be done before beating Brock in Pewter City. At the east end of town is a kid who will take you to the Pewter Gym if you have not beaten him yet. One tile before walking into his line of sight, open the pause menu and hover the cursor over "SAVE". Now, exit the menu with B, then walk in front of the kid. Throughout the conversation that follows, continue pressing B to advance the text. Immediately after the texts ends, press Start, then save the game. Let the kid walk you to the Pewter Gym, then enter the pause menu and reset the console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]After the game reloads, you'll be taken to the Gym again. This time, continue back to Route 3's entrance. This time, the kid won't be there. However, be sure hug the north side of the rock wall as you go east: you'll trigger the conversations again if you do not.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Note, too, that you must beat the Pewter Gym eventually to beat the game. This is best used for those who intend to go back later with a better Pokemon party, such as those who started with Charmander. There is also a walk-through-walls glitch enabled by this. After you execute the glitch and regain control, speak again with the kid from the east side, after which you can walk through walls, but only if you have a Bulbasaur in the second slot of your party at Level 8.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]The Mew Glitch, in its simplest form, can be executed only before getting the Cascade Badge from the Cerulean Gym. First, go onto Route 24 to the north of Cerulean and obtain an Abra there in the grass to the west of Nugget Bridge: be sure not to battle the Youngster in the grass. (The former is not possible in Pokemon Yellow, meaning you will need to trade an Abra to that version. Other Pokemon with Teleport also work.) When you obtain the Abra, go heal in the Cerulean Pokemon Center, so as to be able to have Abra Teleport you there.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Return to Route 24 and to the grass where the Abra was found. You should see a Trainer in the grass: go north until he is off-screen, then get due north of his position. (Now is a good time to save, since failure in this instance is irreversible.) Go south one step and rapidly press Start as you do so: as the Trainer appears on-screen, the menu should appear. Go to the Pokemon menu and have your Abra Teleport you back to Cerulean City; you'll know if this effort was successful if the Trainer gets an "!" mark above their head as you warp. This tricks the game into believing you're in-battle, too, disabling the Start Button menu. When you return to Cerulean, enter the Gym and battle the swimming Trainer. After you do this, head back to Route 24. As you do so, the menu will appear; leave it and a Level 7 Mew will appear.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There are other variants to this glitch that originally only used to find the now-unavailable Mew: however, all methods require a Trainer, such as the aforementioned Youngster, that begins a battle the moment you're on-screen and in his/her vision. It is all based on the last-seen Pokemon's Special stat: the above method is an early way to get a Pokemon with the Special stat of 21 to be the last-seen, thus triggering the appearance of Mew, since Mew's internal ID in the game is 21. Other Pokemon (it can be wild or a Trainer's) can be used to get different Pokemon: the ability to find Ditto late in the game will also allow full manipulation of this process (so long as the Ditto uses Transform in the battle) as you yourself can view the Special stat of the Transformed Pokemon.  This can be used to get any of the Pokemon in the game, even several glitch Pokemon or cause a few battles with Glitch Trainers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]There is one further derivative for this glitch: if you use Growl in the battle with the Pokemon whose Special stat corresponds to the Pokemon you wish to have, you can affect the Level of the Pokemon you get. For each Growl used, the Level goes down by 1: the game maxes at six uses, meaning you can get a Level 1 Pokemon, and this is the only method in which to do so. However, the EXP. growth formula for Level 1 Pokemon is glitched: the next-level EXP. is essentially a large negative number. If the Level 1 Pokemon gains any EXP. in battle - you simply need to switch it out of battle once it's in - it will go straight to Level 100. It will still obey you, since it's your Pokemon as well. However, this effect only works on Pokemon that cannot evolve anymore, such as Charizard, Tauros, Raichu, or Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]You may already know that Cut cuts down small trees to clear a path for yourself. If you use Cut while standing in a patch of grass, it will cut the grass so you won't encounter Pokemon in that spot. The grass is reset if you leave the area.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cuts secondary effect[CR]To get the diploma catch 150 Pokemon and go and see the designer in the mansion in Celedon City. He will then give you the diploma.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1998</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Game Freak</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>8.5</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QghgrmYhGK4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2356</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/367023-pokemon-red-version</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-red-version</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/6679</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2356-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2356-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30875-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64395-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114314-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153015-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254333-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2356-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59851-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-journey-begins.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59852-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-and-it-ends-very-quickly.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59853-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-danger-ahead-fat-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59854-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-can-t-go-that-way-neither.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59855-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-john-wants-to-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59856-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-that-will-teach-him.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59857-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-pokemon-status.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59858-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-my-status.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/356897-pokemon-red-version-game-boy-screenshot-a-wild-battle.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-10.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-2.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-3.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-4.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-5.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-6.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-7.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-8.jpg</fanart9>		<fanart10>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2356-9.jpg</fanart10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/SzH2aIQ.png</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2356.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokemon - Yellow Version - Special Pikachu Edition (USA, Europe) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Pokemon - Yellow Version - Special Pikachu Edition (USA, Europe) (GBC,SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="7D527D62" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPokemon%20-%20Yellow%20Version%20-%20Special%20Pikachu%20Edition%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28GBC%2CSGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="CC7D03262EBFAF2F06772C1A480C7D9D5F4A38E1" size="509457" />		<title_clean>Pokemon - Yellow Version - Special Pikachu Edition</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pok&#233;mon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition is the fourth installment in the Pok&#233;mon series. It was developed by Game Freak for the Nintendo Game Boy, and is essentially an updated version of the Pok&#233;mon Red/Blue titles, with changes made in order for the game to more closely follow the events of the Pok&#233;mon anime series.[CR]Perhaps the most significant change from the previous versions is the fact that players are no longer given the choice of the three Starter Pok&#233;mon (Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charmander), but are instead given a Pikachu by Professor Oak at the start of the game (as also occurs in the anime series). Pikachu follows the character around the world instead of being stored in a Pok&#233; Ball, and its personality and attitude towards the player can be affected how you play the game (frequently fainting causes Pikachu to become hostile towards you, for example).[CR]Parallels to Anime[CR]One of the ideas behind Pokemon Yellow was to tie into the anime, starting from a redesign of all the characters, and even the Pokemon. Gary, Professor Oak and, most notably, Misty and Brock have been redesigned to look more like the characters from the anime. The player's starter is always Pikachu, and Gary starts with an Eevee. Gary has no fan club, however, as he does in the show.[CR]Team Rocket is a major player as per the original games, but Jesse and James are now actual characters, using Koffing, Ekans and Meowth. Giovanni, the boss of Team Rocket, has had his team overhauled to be more in tune with his anime counterpart, including a Persian.[CR]Pokemon Centers are now staffed by Nurse Joy counterparts, as well as Chanseys. Your character also has the option of getting all the starter Pokemon again, and in similar ways to the show: Bulbasaur is given away by a girl after you defeat Misty because she feels he's being held back by staying there with her; Charmander is given away by some dude who doesn't want it anymore; Squirtle is given away by Officer Jenny for being too much of a rabble-rouser.[CR]Most importantly, however, is Pikachu, as mentioned before, and the fact it follows you around. It even goes through stages similar to those of the Pikachu in the show, where it at first distrusts you but then grows to enjoy you more. It also refuses to be evolved if you try (making you have to trade over a Pikachu from another game if you want a Raichu).[CR]Differences from Red/Blue[CR]This game is mostly an update to the games, and a lot of the gameplay changes are cosmetic. Genders, abilities and breeding aren't introduced until later games, and the game is mostly at the simplest RPG roots (see Gameplay below). Other changes are enumerated above as just making it more like the anime, so in the end, the other biggest change is for collectors of the Pokemon. The exclusive Pokemon in this version are a mix of both games, making it far easier to catch them all. Some of the trades have been changed as well, or removed completely (the man who traded you the Jynx in Red/Blue is replaced by the girl who gives you Bulbasaur, for example). It's an incremental upgrade, and set the standard for Crystal and Emerald coming further down the line.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Pok&#233;mon Yellow is based upon the turn-based battle system that debuted in Red/Blue version. The player's Pok&#233;mon are only allowed to have a maximum of 4 attacks. There are different kinds of attacks, such as special attacks and physical attacks. The attacks and all Pok&#233;mon are also all divided in types, such as water type, fire type, rock type, psychic type, and should a Pok&#233;mon use an attack with similar type to his he gains a boost in damage. The Pok&#233;mon are able to learn new abilities; however, since they are only allowed to have 4 attacks, the player must choose wisely if he or she wishes to forget an attack in order to learn a new attack, for a forgotten technique can not be recovered in most cases.[CR]Learning new attacks require the Pok&#233;mon to level up. Leveling up happens by gaining experience points when challenging and defeating other Pok&#233;mon, which can be from other trainers or random Pok&#233;mon found in the wild. When facing another trainer the player will have to choose a Pok&#233;mon in their inventory to battle one of the opponent's Pok&#233;mon, if emerging victorious, the trainer will also earn money used buy items such as potions, Pok&#233; Balls, etc. When enough experience is collected, the Pok&#233;mon will be able to learn certain attacks based on their type, the attack and which level is happens depends on the Pok&#233;mon. The player is also allowed to switch Pok&#233;mon in mid-battle if the situation permits it; however, the Pok&#233;mon switched and the Pok&#233;mon which was switched for will divide the experience received equally should the enemy be downed. This strategy allows players to level up weak Pok&#233;mon quickly if done correctly. And if the player levels up their Pok&#233;mon to a certain level, the Pok&#233;mon will evolve. Evolving allows the Pok&#233;mon to take on a new form, becoming stronger and being able to learn attacks that it wouldn't be able to learn before. But if the player wishes for their Pok&#233;mon to stay at that stage, he or she can rapidly tap the B button to stop the evolution when the evolution screen sets in.[CR]When players put their Pok&#233;mon into battle, they will most likely receive damage eventually. If the Pok&#233;mon are injured too much, the player must take them to the Pok&#233;mon Center in order for the Pok&#233;mon's Hit Points (HP) to be fully restored and all stat changes be restored to normal. But if there isn't a Pok&#233;mon Center nearby, players are able to buy potions and other healing items to heal their Pok&#233;mon during or after battle. Players can buy potions from Pok&#233;Marts located throughout the game as well as finding the items scattered around during the adventure. The player is only able to buy a maximum of 99 of each different type of item. Like any RPG, items play a decisive role in the game, some items give the ability to teach a Pok&#233;mon techniques, even some which the Pok&#233;mon wouldn't normally learn though leveling up, these are called Technical Machines (TM), and they work as normal attacks would do when taught to any Pok&#233;mon able to receive such technique, though there are 50 of them in the game, each TM can only be used once, being rendered useless afterwards; though most of them can only be attained once, some of them can be bought in shops and can theoretically be used how many times the player wishes, granting the player has the money to buy. There's another kind of technique called Hidden Machines (HM), this can be used as much as the player wants, it doesn't lose effect after usage, and though they can also used to attack during battle, their primary function is to help the player overcome certain natural obstacles during the adventure, such as cutting trees obstructing the way, or surfing. A Pok&#233;mon is required for these actions and once the Pok&#233;mon learns a Hidden Machine they will never unlearn it.[CR]In order to catch Pok&#233;mon, the player requires to have Pok&#233;balls. A Pok&#233;ball allows a player to capture any wild Pok&#233;mon in the game. Some Pok&#233;mon are stronger than others; therefore, it requires the player to weaken them first with his or her Pok&#233;mon before it can be caught. Pok&#233;balls are purchased from the Pok&#233;Mart. There are different types of Pok&#233;balls, and each of them have a different percentage of effectiveness on catching Pok&#233;mon. Since the player is only able to carry a maximum of 6 Pok&#233;mon within their inventory any extra Pok&#233;mon caught is instantly sent to be stored in the PC. If a player decides to switch Pok&#233;mon, then they would be required to go to a PC located in any Pok&#233;mon Center to do so, from there, the player is allowed to switch whatever Pok&#233;mon that he or she has already caught from their PCs to their inventory and vice-versa.[CR]Your primary goal in Pok&#233;mon Yellow is becoming the greatest Pok&#233;mon trainer of all, to to achieve that you have to train Pok&#233;mon to take on the Elite Four, which is formed by the very four best Pok&#233;mon trainers around, after taking down all the Pok&#233;mon from the four trainers you still have to face the Elite Champion to, then, if you manage to win the battle, become the newest champion. To do that you won't have access to Pok&#233;mon Center's care for your Pok&#233;mon and you will have to deal with the six Pok&#233;mon you choose in the beginning against all 5 trainers, it is allowed to stock up items and use them in any of your Pok&#233;mon at will, but changing one Pok&#233;mon downed for some other with full health won't be allowed. When you beat the Elite and the champion your name and Pok&#233;mon will go down in the hall of fame. You can still come back and battle the Elite Four anytime after you beat them the first time, it's actually one of the best places in the game for easy and high amount of experience, and you also receive money out of each trainer defeated, making it a great monetary source as well.[CR]Pok&#233;mon Gyms[CR]During the adventure you'll have to face 8 different gym leaders and beat them to acquire their badges, and with them, get allowed into Victory Road and reach Indigo Plateau for the Elite. Each Pok&#233;mon Gym Leader is an specialist in some Pok&#233;mon type, it's important to notice their type for better chances of counter-attacking with a strong type Pok&#233;mon. Here are the gym leaders, their location, their specialty and Pok&#233;mon used.Pewter City Gym[CR]Leader - Brock[CR]Badge - Boulder Badge[CR]Pok&#233;mon Type - Rock/Ground[CR]Pok&#233;mon Used - Geodude, OnyxCerulean City Gym[CR]Leader - Misty[CR]Badge - Cascade Badge[CR]Pok&#233;mon Type - Water[CR]Pok&#233;mon Used - Staryu, StarmieVermilion City Gym[CR]Leader - Lt.

The evolution will depend on your actions in the game, here are the three sets of Pok&#233;mon he might be using[CR]With Vaporeon - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Ninetales, Magneton[CR]With Jolteon - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Ninetales, Cloyster[CR]With Flareon - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Cloyster, Magneton[CR]Evolving Gary's Eevee[CR]Gary's Eevee evolution hinges on the first two battles with him-first in Oak's office and then in the route outside of Viridian, before the Pokemon League entrance. They proceed as follows:Vaporeon[CR]To get Vaporeon, you must lose both battles with him (alternately, you could just skip the second battle, which counts as a loss). Presumably this is to make his later battles easier, since Pikachu is super-effective against water. A cunning trainer would let Gary win both times, though, and just use this to destroy him easier later.Flareon[CR]Win one, lose the other. It doesn't really matter which you win and which you lose, but it's easier to win the first match and then, once more, skipping the second battle.Jolteon[CR]Process of elimination should show that to get him to fight with a Jolteon, simply win both matches. It's the hardest evolution, because you're not very effective against it with your Pikachu.[CR]Technical Machines[CR]Here's a list of all Technical Machines found in the game.Technical MachinesAttack--TM01Mega PunchTM02Razor WindTM03Sword's DanceTM04WhirlwindTM05Mega KickTM06ToxicTM07Horn DrillTM08Body SlamTM09Take DownTM10Double EdgeTM11Bubble BeamTM12Water GunTM13Ice BeamTM14BlizzardTM15Hyper BeamTM16Pay DayTM17SubmissionTM18CounterTM19Seismic TossTM20RageTM21Mega DrainTM22Solar BeamTM23Dragon RageTM24ThunderboltTM25ThunderTM26EarthquakeTM27FissureTM28DigTM29PsychicTM30TeleportTM31MimicTM32Double TeamTM33ReflectTM34BideTM35MetronomeTM36Self DestructTM37Egg BombTM38Fire BlastTM39SwiftTM40Skull BashTM41Soft BoiledTM42Dream EaterTM43Sky AttackTM44RestTM45Thunder WaveTM46PsywaveTM47ExplosionTM48Rock SlideTM49Tri AttackTM50Substitute[CR]Hidden Machine[CR]Here's a list of all Hidden Machines found in the game.Hidden MachineAblityHM01CutHM02FlyHM03SurfHM04StrengthHM05Flash[CR]Surfing Pikachu[CR]One of the new features in Pok&#233;mon Yellow is the possibility to play a mini-games called "Surfing Pikachu", you just had to show up at the house near the beach in route 19 and have a Pikachu who knows the technique "Surf" as one of his four moves. Of course Pikachu doesn't naturally learn Surf so the player could get one at Nintendo events, but the best way to get a Pikachu with Surf would be Pok&#233;mon Stadium 2. If you manage to beat Round 2's Prime Cub Master Ball with a team containing the Pikachu you receive at the beginning of Pok&#233;mon Yellow (it has to be Pikachu from Yellow, the one the follows you around) without using continues and making Pikachu participate of all battles until the end, then you would have the option to teach Surf to Pikachu at the end, being able to use it in the game and participate the mini-game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally when under the effects of Toxic ("Bad Poisoning"), your Pokemon takes incrementing amounts of damage: 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, and so on, of their max HP. You can negate this by switching out; when the Pokemon returns, it will only be taking a flat 1/8 damage like regular Poisoning.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, assure no save file exists on your game; if it does, hold Up, Select, and B at the title screen and clear the file. Start a new game and do the usual introduction, but choose "ASH" for your name and "BLUE" for your rival's. When given control, walk downstairs in your house to the tile north of the eastern tile of the entrance mat. Open the menu and then save the game. When you select "YES", very quickly thereafter (the timing can take several tries), turn off the console mid-save. (The timing is between the text box with "YES"/"NO" disappearing and the save confirmation message changing.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]If done right, you can access your file and go into the Pokemon menu, but it's blank and extended beyond 6 Pokemon. Grab a Pokemon between slots 1-9 (those immediately on-screen) and swap it with slot 10's Pokemon. Take slot 11 and switch it with slot 9. Go to your Items menu next, and hold Down until the cursor stops flashing. Hit A and glitch the menu, then hit Down, A, Down, A in that order. Now look down the list for a Master Ball. Go down one more item and press Select. Scroll down until you see another Master Ball, and press Select to swap it with the item you grabbed. Now, toss 68 of that item. Exit the menu and then exit your house to walk straight into the Hall of Fame! You'll get the game completion scene as normal, and often have more than 150 Pokemon in your Pokedex![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Leech Seed is a move well-known for absorbing 1/16 of the target's HP and healing the user of the move by the same amount. However, you can actually boost this damage through the unintended effects of Toxic. When you use Toxic to Badly Poison a foe, and then use Leech Seed on them, Leech Seed's damage will also increment: thus, you regain 1/16, then 1/8, then 3/16, then 1/4, and so on, of your HP. Toxic will also be taking effect in this time, dealing the same amount of damage. In other words, you not only regain tons of HP, but also double the damage of Toxic, from one point of view.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]To get onto the Cycling Road without needing a Bicycle, simply hold Left while the guard warns you that you must have the Bicycle to enter Cycling Road. (If you already obtained the Bicycle, this still works if the Bicycle is in the PC.) In doing so, you will bypass the guard; if you continue onto Cycling Road, you'll still ride a bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Have ABRA in your party. Go up Nugget bridge in Cerulean City and to the left to the trainer facing north.  Stand right to his left and make sure he doesn't see you. Head north until he is off screen.  Go one step east. Step south and pause the game before he has a ! over his head. Use teleport. Fight the first trainer in Cerulean gym and use Growl 6 times.  Kill his Pokemon and go back to Nugget Bridge. The game will pause automatically. Press B to find a level 1 Mew.  Catch it and put it at the front of your party. Go in tall grass, find a wild Pokemon, and switch Mew with a different Pokemon. Kill the wild Pokemon. Mew will level up to 100. Do this glitch again with the trainer facing north on the route to Bill's house to get another level 100 Mew.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you first start your game, you will have 1 potion in your pc that's in your room. Get it out. Continue playing the game untill you get Pikachu but haven't battled Gary's Eevee yet. Use the potion on Pikachu 5 times (even though it won't have any effect). Fight Gary and WIN. After the battle, when your Pikachu comes out of the Pokeball. He will like you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch can be executed on Pokemon who have used Hyper Beam and are Frozen during their recharging turn. If you use Haze on this Pokemon, they will thaw out - however, they will always be recharging from their Hyper Beam, meaning they and their Trainer can do nothing until you defeat it. You can capitalize on this with healing across the party, massive stat boosts, and inevitably killing the Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]In the Celadon Hotel, you will notice that the graphics and internal structure of the building are much the same as that of a Pokemon Center. There is even a PC here, although it is invisible: it is in the same spot as a normal Pokemon Center along the east wall. The same is also true of some of the Rest Houses in the Safari Zone that have Pokemon Center-like design. You can interact with this PC as normal to insert and withdraw your Pokemon.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR] However, take note that if saving is done your actual location will not be saved. This can be used to some degree for sequence-breaking glitches and speed-running by saving in one area by changing PC boxes, then reloading the file. You'll have all your progress done as before, but your location will be the same the file before this save. For example, you can save normally in Pallet Town, then do so in the Celadon Hotel by using its invisible PC. When you reload, you'll have met all of the progress you did between Pallet Town and the Celadon Hotel but will be back in Pallet Town.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch is executed when a Pokemon using Fly or Dig becomes Paralyzed before the turn on which they attack: it is only done by being Paralyzed when you are high up in the air when using Fly. If such occurs, you will be invulnerable. This glitch lasts until your Pokemon uses Fly or Dig again and is successful in doing so, you switch Pokemon, the Pokemon faints, or the battle ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally, when Burned, a Pokemon's Attack stat is halved, and when Paralyzed their Speed is halved. However, if you use Swords Dance (if Burned) or Agility (if Paralyzed), the stat loss is negated. For example, under the intended mechanics, Swords Dance and Burn would return you to normal damage output, but it actually doubles your damage output. The same is true for Speed, Paralysis, and Agility.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]Normally in Pokemon, the move Struggle (used when a Pokemon is at 0 PP for all moves) is intended to be a typeless move. However, in these games it is mistakenly coded as a Normal-type move. This means that you can use a Ghost-type Pokemon against them and easily win as they won't be able to hurt you.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]This glitch requires you to have the Badges allowing the use of Fly and Surf, and Pokemon that can use these moves. You must also be able to reach Fuschia City or Cinnabar Island. First, head to Viridian City and speak with the old man near Route 2 who will teach you to catch Pokemon; view his tutorial. After doing so, Fly to Fuschia or Cinnabar and Surf to the Seafoam Islands. Once there, Surf on the coastline of the islands.As you Surf, you may encounter a number of odd Pokemon. These Pokemon will differ, depending on the name you used as that of your Trainer. For example, the name "DANIEL" can make Snorlax or Electrode appear, among others. However, a common characteristic of them is that they are often above Level 100 and thus very powerful: if you manage to catch one somehow, you essentially have a very powerful Pokemon, and can even level it up further, as high as Level 255. (Note that some Pokemon may evolve into glitch Pokemon because of this.) That is the first benefit of this simple glitch.Most people, regardless of name, should be able to encounter one of two Pokemon: Missingno. or 'M, both of which are glitch Pokemon. These two have special effects on the item in the sixth slot of your item bag, but that effect depends on whether you catch or defeat the Pokemon. If you defeat the Pokemon (or otherwise just do not catch it), the item in your Bag's sixth slot will be changed so that you have 128 of it; if you catch it, you will have 255 of it. (This is assuming you use an item that you can have multiple ones of.) This is very useful for mass-cloning valuable items, such as Master Balls, Rare Candies, or PP Maxes, or to clone TMs to sell for obscene amounts of money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]First, begin this by going to the Safari Zone in Fuschia. Arrive there with only one Pokemon in your party, and this Pokemon must be Poisoned (PSN). Enter the Safari Zone gatehouse and pay $500 to begin playing. Immediately upon entrance, go back into the gatehouse and, when asked if you wish to leave, say "No.". Then save the game and reset the console, then reload your save file.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]When you reload, begin counting every single step you take - this is very crucial to this glitch. When you reload, go into the Safari Zone building and opt to not play the game. Walk around now and be sure to do so near a ledge. Count until you have taken 499 steps and land the 499th step next to the ledge. (You can also count for 124 flashes of the screen, due to Poisoning, and 3 additional steps.) Heal your Pokemon periodically as well so that they do not faint (keeping the Poison active). [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alter Toxic Damage[CR]On the 500th step, do it so that you walk off the aforementioned ledge for it, thereby ending your Safari Game from earlier in mid-air. You will return into the Safari Zone gatehouse. [B]Do not try leaving through the exit or your game will crash![/B] This is why I mentioned keeping Poison active: you have to have your Poisoned Pokemon - your lone Pokemon in the party - faint by walking around due to Poison. You will then return to the last-used Pokemon Center, your Pokemon fully healed - however, there's a key difference in that you now can walk through walls and across water - basically anywhere you wish! The effects of this glitch will last until you enter a battle or speak with an NPC or enter a building.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get the Diploma[CR]Complete your Pokedex (Mew is optional) and visit the game designer in the Celadon Mansion. He will give you a diploma as a reward.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Once you've obtained the HM Cut you can use it to teach some of your pokemon the attack of the same name.[CR]This ability now cannot only be used to cut down certain trees but also to get rid of any grass so you don't have to bother with any random encounters.[CR]When saving and loading or leaving and reentering the area you used cut in, the grass will have returned.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Use the Pikachu from your Pokemon Yellow in every match in the Tournament mode of Pokemon Stadium. Pikachu should learn Surf. Now go south of Fuschia City and into the house at the beach. Talk to the man inside. Make sure Pikachu is in your party. You should be able to play a mini-game.</plot>		<releasedate>25/10/1999</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Nintendo Co., Nintendo of America Inc., Nintendo of Europe GmbH</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>QofMrP7aOLY</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>2359</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/198314-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/pokmon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-yellow-special-pikachu-edition/3030-18673/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2359-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2359-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36287-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35554-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30298-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69878-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/118838-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202438-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart8>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2359-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606620-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606621-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88927-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88928-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88929-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88930-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88931-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88932-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/88933-pokemon-yellow-version-special-pikachu-edition-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-2.jpg</fanart2>		<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-3.jpg</fanart3>		<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-4.jpg</fanart4>		<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-5.jpg</fanart5>		<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-6.jpg</fanart6>		<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-7.jpg</fanart7>		<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-8.jpg</fanart8>		<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2359-9.jpg</fanart9>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2359-g.jpg</banner1>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2359.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Pokonyan!

Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as "Urth"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.[CR]A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.[CR] Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.[CR]During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.[CR]After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as "king of the hill". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish "dinosaur graveyard", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.[CR]The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Time Warner Interactive</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>2.3</rating>		<videoid>_N3ByaZdaJ4</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13106</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585861-primal-rage</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/primal-rage</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/primal-rage/3030-14078/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13106-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/1/4/11114_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21841-primal-rage-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21842-primal-rage-game-boy-screenshot-opening-cinematic.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21843-primal-rage-game-boy-screenshot-talon-vs-talon.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21844-primal-rage-game-boy-screenshot-chaos-vs-chaos.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21845-primal-rage-game-boy-screenshot-sauron-vs-armadon.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/9/e/gfs_46687_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/4/e/gfs_46687_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/e/e/gfs_46687_1_4.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/5/e/gfs_46687_1_5.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/8/e/gfs_46687_1_6.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Prince of Persia (USA)">		<description>Prince of Persia (USA)</description>		<rom crc="2BD995F1" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FPrince%20of%20Persia%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="EF3EF15B791CEFF34D7D9BB5B3AF2E05842C8323" size="67425" />		<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989[CR]Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.[CR]Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.[CR]Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.[CR]The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.[CR]The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.[CR]The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.[CR]The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.[CR]The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES version[CR]Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.[CR]The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.[CR]The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate code to go to the desired level:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Password generator[CR]The password in this game consists of an eight digit number.

The A button fires your gun and the B button throws grenades.[CR]The object is to kill the bad guys who either are walking around or hiding in the environment while also picking up ammo, grenades and health by shooting them. Your health is constantly drained while enemies are shooting, so if you want to last, you must cap them as soon as they appear.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/punisher-ultimate-payback[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various Cheats[CR]All cheats are to be entered on the Title Screen, you will hear a confirmation sound.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Acclaim</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.0</rating>		<videoid>ZqXMw8URg9E</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21704</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585863-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/punisher-the-ultimate-payback</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-punisher-ultimate-payback/3030-14411/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21704-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206671-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204069-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204070-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204071-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-spider.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204072-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204074-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-shoot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204075-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-one.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204076-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-enemies.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204079-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-guess.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204081-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-shooting.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204082-the-punisher-the-ultimate-payback-game-boy-screenshot-hostage.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Purikura Pocket -

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.[CR]There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)[CR]The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the main menu where it shows 1Player, 2Players, and Password, either select 1Player or Password.

Also released in Europe in 1991, Pyramids of Ra was developed by Source Research &amp; Development. Originally, an NES version of Pyramids of Ra was planned. Several such prototypes exist, including a modified black and white version of Pyramids of Ra called Scarabeus. These games were never released, but can be found in various forms on the internet and in physical cartridge form. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Immediately after jumping off a tile, it is destroyed.     The goal in Pyramids of Ra is to clear each stage of every tile, while also managing to return to the starting point. Players can move one tile in each direction (up, down, left, right), although it is possible to "jump off" the playing field, as well as the possibility of destroying the incorrect tiles to trap the player or render some tiles inaccessible.  Staying too long on a single tile also destroys it. There is a meter displayed at the top of the screen that, when the player is stationary, quickly decreases in size, requiring the player to move before the destruction of the tile.  Rather than containing a save system, Pyramids of Ra has a password system. Passwords are entirely comprised of letters, rather than typical alphanumeric password systems in games of the time. Each level has its own password, displayed when the game is paused. There are five tombs in the game, each with its own individual levels:  Unis, Teti, Khafre, Snefru, and Scarabeus. Tiles There is a wide variety of tiles in Pyramids of Ra, each of which have different effects on the playing field. Some of these tiles actually cannot be destroyed, making them unnecessary before returning to the start.   Darker colored tiles can be jumped on multiple times. One/Two/Three/Unlimited Bounce Tile - The most common forms of tile, these each allow the player to touch them a certain amount of times before they are destroyed (except for the Unlimited tile, which is&#8230; unlimited). Jump Tile - An indestructible tile that launches the player the direction that the arrow is pointing. It typically launches players over gaps. Rotating Jump Tile - Similar to the Jump Tile, save for the fact that it is perpetually spinning in a circle. Moving Tile - As per its name, the Moving Tile moves back and forth in certain directions over gaps. The player must time jumps correctly to land on this tile. Scarabs - Not necessarily a tile type, Scarabs are enemies that roam tiles in later levels. Players must jump over them in order to avoid being killed. Horizontal/Vertical Flip - These tiles flip the playing field according to their description. The two forms are Horizontal and Vertical, each of which flips that direction that it describes. Reverse Direction - These tiles alter the player's control, rather than flipping the stage. When the player is on a Reverse Direction tile, right moves left, up moves down, and vice versa. Unknown Tiles - Similar to the One/Two/Three series of tiles, these don't reveal how many times they must be jumped on to be destroyed. It varies depending on the tile. Reversed Moving Tile - A combination of the Reverse Direction tile and Moving Tile. Vertical/Horizontal Flip Moving Tile - A combination of the Vertical/Horizontal Flip tile and the Moving Tile.

To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.[CR]Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional  or even four-dimensional  thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.[CR]A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Time[CR]Pause the game and enter the following code to attain infinite time: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Enter the following codes to skip levels.</plot>		<releasedate>14/4/1990</releasedate>		<year>1989</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>SETA U.S.A.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<videoid>JVExGLevP0o</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21706</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585865-q-billion</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/q-billion</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/q-billion/3030-27985/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/26763/1119605-box_scan005.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218681-q-billion-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297541-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297550-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-choose-a-game.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297552-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-the-american-version-is-self.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297553-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-build-a-platform-to-stand-on.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297554-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-all-blocks-are-only-1-layer.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297555-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-stage-clear.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297557-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-it-is-not-easy-to-reach-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297558-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-first-make-one-2-into-two-1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297559-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-then-push-the-remaining-2-on.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/297543-q-billion-game-boy-screenshot-a-puzzle-like-this-requires.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Q-bert for Game Boy (USA, Europe)">		<description>Q-bert for Game Boy (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="B0109545" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FQ-bert%20for%20Game%20Boy%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="BD56A1E96C3D310B522E25D7B72CEEF26AF87F2E" size="41120" />		<title_clean>Q-bert for Game Boy</title_clean>		<plot>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/qbert[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Movie[CR]On the title screen, press Right, Up, B, A, Down, Up, B, Down, up, B.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Jaleco Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>Xkbb9aFiU-g</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>23339</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585866-qbert</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/qbert-for-game-boy/3030-46515/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23339-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/23339-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/1/9/gfs_96852_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/c/9/gfs_96852_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/f/5/gfs_2495_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/2/5/gfs_2495_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="QIX (World)">		<description>QIX (World)</description>		<rom crc="9185E89E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FQIX%20%28World%29.zip" sha1="FB9935CA821562966EAFA8F60EC2F489AD33940A" size="38042" />		<title_clean>QIX</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In QIX, the objective is to fence in a large majority of the play field and defeat the QIX. Players must close in the large enemy, the QIX, in a closed space without it touching the player or the lines drawn by the player. Every time the player creates a closed space, they are awarded points and the space becomes solid so the QIX can no longer pass through it. Other enemies besides the QIX exist in the form of Sparx. The Sparx moves on the lines that the player draws and can defeat the player in the same way as the QIX.[CR]QIX was originally released in arcades in 1981 but Taito ported the game to a large variety of consoles such as the Atari 5200, Atari 400/800, Apple II, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga (with new graphics), Apple IIGS, NES, and Atari Lynx.

The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.[CR]R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[CR]R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first level[CR]The Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators. [CR] The Ship [CR]The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter. The Force[CR]The R-9a "Arrowhead" can be equipped with an indestructible living weapon called "The Force". The force, a spherical pod that can be attached to the ship, is made of Bydo flesh and can absorb energy in order to increase in power. To obtain the force, the player must obtain a weapon power up. The force will appear behind the players ship and they can obtain the force by flying into it. [CR]The force acts as the ship's weapon system and will fire in the whatever direction it is facing. The force also acts as a shield and can be used to block incoming enemy attacks. [CR]The force has three levels of power. Collecting weapon power ups increases the power level of the force. The forces visual appearance changes as it increases in power.Red - A powerful counter-air laser beam that fires horizontally.Blue - Three thin laser beams. One forward firing and two that fire at a 45 degree angle from the front of the ship These beams rebound off walls.Yellow - Two flame beams that fire above and below the ship. These flames can travel along the ground or walls to destroy enemies.[CR]The force can be controlled by the user by using the force button.

The first is very recognizable, with a map to select and place the ships. Then the game is played by picking squares (e.g. A5). There are several different ships, ranging from the five-hit aircraft carriers to the two hit cruisers, even a fighter jet in later levels.[CR]The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player's vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level.  When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player's ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2

forces with the artillery within those fortifications. After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>30/10/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Jaleco Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>1.6</rating>		<videoid>EPTaUT2hG38</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>16293</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/258449-rampart</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/rampart</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/rampart/3030-19146/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5390</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3413/235054-rampart.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/8/3/10483_back.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/106304-rampart-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/148065-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/148066-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-player-selection-jpn.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/148069-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-player-selection.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/148067-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-choose-you-map.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/148068-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-a-hint-before-you-get-started.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/449910-rampart-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-us-version.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/d/gfs_2496_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/1/1/gfs_92283_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/c/gfs_92283_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/5/c/gfs_92283_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ranma 1-2 (Japan)">		<description>Ranma 1-2 (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="4E05537E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FRanma%201-2%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="C869D7FC1FCE8EA7CA534E29E8DA826017F4CA4F" size="46200" />		<title_clean>Ranma 1-2</title_clean>		<plot>Ranma 1/2: Kakugeki Mondou!! is a Role-Playing game, developed by Sun L and published by Banpresto,which was released in Japan in 1993.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Strong Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters.

The story is very simple: Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There's no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level.[CR]Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially: drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There's also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level.[CR]The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level.[CR]In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords (Garfield)[CR]At the password entry screen...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords (Garfield)[CR]Enter the appropriate code to go to the desired level:</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1993</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Activision</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.6</rating>		<videoid>aRtTCG9dD7w</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21710</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585874-the-real-ghostbusters</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/real-ghostbusters_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-real-ghostbusters/3030-27203/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21710-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/2/8/42128_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/453092-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/453093-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-intro-garfield-and.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/453094-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-garfield-falls-down.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/453095-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-it-is-shown-how.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/453096-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/456920-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-as.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/456921-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-huh.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/456922-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-falling.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/456923-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-showing-you-how.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/456924-the-real-ghostbusters-game-boy-screenshot-stage-1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Red Arremer - Makai Mura Gaiden (Japan)">		<description>Red Arremer - Makai Mura Gaiden (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="AE0122AA" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FRed%20Arremer%20-%20Makai%20Mura%20Gaiden%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="DD49A66372411DA76023E993B3476190F76EECA8" size="88344" />		<title_clean>Red Arremer - Makai Mura Gaiden</title_clean>		<plot>Originally released in 1990 for the Nintendo Game Boy system, the arcade action platformer stars Firebrand, the gargoyle from Ghosts 'n Goblins who can also be seen in the upcoming Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 fighting game.

Stimpy can vomit a projectile furball across the screen, but Ren can only slap his foes.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>THQ Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<videoid>HwqgUR7kD58</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>20549</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585875-the-ren-and-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures/3030-24359/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20549-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424903-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424905-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424906-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424908-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424910-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424911-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424914-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424915-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/424917-the-ren-stimpy-show-space-cadet-adventures-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/6/6/gfs_38701_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, The - Veediots!

Bowe. It is based heavily on the 1992 Sega Genesis licensed boxing game Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal Boxing and includes many of the same systems as well as the horizontal perspective that shows both boxers, though the title boxer has been changed and the graphics have become more cartoonish and light.[CR]It was published on the Super Nintendo in the US by Extreme Entertainment Group and in Japan by Micronet. There was no European release.[CR]The game was released in Mexico by American Softworks with the name Chavez, putting Julio Cesar Chavez in the title role instead of Riddick Bowe. Chavez is largely identical to Riddick Bowe Boxing, except for the title screen, main character and being exclusively in Spanish. There was also a Chavez II, which was originally Boxing Legends of the Ring after it had undergone a similar superficial facelift.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired level:</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Ocean Software Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.5</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>23340</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575182-road-rash</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/road-rash</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/road-rash/3030-8251/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5403</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23340-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172249-road-rash-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/170584-road-rash-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166613-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166614-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-course.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166615-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-at-the-start-of-each-race-the.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166616-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-starting-grid.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166618-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-avoiding-cars-and-opponents.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/166619-road-rash-game-boy-screenshot-race-results.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/d/gfs_34209_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/6/d/gfs_34209_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/2/0/gfs_34209_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/f/0/gfs_34209_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Roadster (Japan)">		<description>Roadster (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="04453E78" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FRoadster%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="685C31496DE738C27160D1F75408DA6B95DAAAE8" size="66262" />		<title_clean>Roadster</title_clean>		<plot>Roadster is a Driving game, developed by TOSE and published by Tonkin House,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>19/10/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing, Arcade</genre>		<studio>TOSE</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/579723-roadster</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/2/4/311424_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/2/2/gfs_20411_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/f/2/gfs_20411_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/4/2/gfs_20411_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/b/f/gfs_20411_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/6/f/gfs_20411_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/d/f/gfs_20411_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/c/f/gfs_20411_2_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/7/f/gfs_20411_2_5.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/a/f/gfs_20411_2_6.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/f/gfs_20411_2_7.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (USA)">		<description>Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (USA)</description>		<rom crc="E5C8C2B1" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FRobin%20Hood%20-%20Prince%20of%20Thieves%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="999BB7878472B657375E04B75ED86EFA90933A55" size="134621" />		<title_clean>Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are three game modes, the main one consisting of an overhead view action RPG incorporating elements such as real-time combat, hit points, leveling, inventory management across you and your companions (though they did NOT show up in the gameplay of this mode), upgradable armor/weapons, and quest items. A side view mode was implemented for boss battles with one on one dueling that also incorporated your gear and health. Finally, there was a melee overhead mode and this was where your party members could become involved (again with the whatever gear you've given them, though Azeem will always have his big sword unless you equip him with anything other than the dagger).[CR]Also, don't talk to Marian after getting the dagger from her (this will hopefully make sense in context). All she'll do is steal Duncan from you like in the movie. He's blind but somehow still useful in the melee mode and he's a great packmule for all your loot (which he TAKES if he leaves).[CR]There is also a cheat password system that can warp you to farther parts of the game. They are mainly based on key words like putting in TAX for the tax wagon mission.

To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all.[CR]The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</plot>		<releasedate>14/8/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Interplay Productions</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.1</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21716</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585882-robocop-versus-the-terminator</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/robocop-vs-the-terminator</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/robocop-versus-the-terminator/3030-12494/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21716-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66163-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66164-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-on-patrol.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66165-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-a-punk.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66166-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-crouch-shot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66167-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-shooting-upwards.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66168-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-climbing-ladders.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66169-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-gunman-on-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66170-robocop-vs-the-terminator-game-boy-screenshot-jump-over-bins.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/a/f/gfs_38706_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/7/f/gfs_38706_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Rock'n!

The arcade version differs greatly from the home versions because it features better graphics and many more levels. The arcade essentially featured a sequel of Rodland upon completion of the game. It feels like a sequel because it features even better visuals and many original levels. The home consoles and computers never received a version of Rodland featuring the sequel. [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR] Tam and Rit holding the Rods of Sheesanomo[CR]Fairies Tam and Rit find out that their mother has been kidnapped by evil monsters. They are each granted with magical wands, called the Rods of Sheesanomo, that give them powers. With their new powers they can defeat the monsters and rescue their kidnapped mother. [CR] [CR] [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] resembles many platformers of the time[CR]Rodland is an action platformer where you play as fairies Tam and Rit. Each level is featured entirely on one screen, and the levels are populated with monsters. The goal is to simply to defeat all the enemies on screen using tricks and the magic wands. The magic wands can only stun the monsters, but once they are stunned you can kill them. The fairies navigate levels by running along multiple platforms that are connected by ladders. There are ladders in each level, but the player can also create ladders. Every time you create a ladder the previous one disappears which allows opportunities to dispose of enemies. [CR] Bonus Levels[CR]The arcade version featured a sequel with a new story, levels and visuals, but the gameplay stayed largely the same. In the sequel you still play as Tam and Rit, but this time they are out to avenge their father's death. Tam and Rit travel through a pyramid where the enemy that killed their father rests.

Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City). It uses the name and likeness of starting pitcher Roger Clemens back when he was with the Boston Red Sox. The Japanese release of the game dropped the license and was simply released as MVP Baseball.[CR]The games uses fictional team and players (besides Roger Clemens) with 26 teams to choose from overall, and the player can select an exhibition mode for one-off games or the long season mode which contains 162 games overall. Rather than saving the player's progress, the game provides a password system to allow the player to resume the season from where they left off.

If this is done correctly, the Talon will be bouncing in short intervals inside the barrier.[CR]3) After you quickly figure out how to control where you bounce to, use the control pad to continue bouncing for fun or steer the game of Talon-Pong out of the barrier.[CR]4) Once you are outside the barrier, the glitch will be over, but you can do it over and over again as you so desire to.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Barrier Fun[CR]At the start of the game, have Myron (your 4th party member at that point) enter his Item menu and de-equip his weapon (the Battle Axe). When the fight is over and player resumes control of the game, you will find that Myron is now your 5th party member and that your inventory has an extra Battle Axe. This is an advanced weapon at this point in the game and a valuable alternative to grinding.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Barrier Fun[CR]Buy enough stuff so you have very little gold then find an enemy that can steal more gold than you have. Let it do so then flee from the battle. Your gold will underflow but instead of having 0 gold you'll have somewhere around 16.7 million gold.Note: The amount of gold will reset to 999,999 if you do anything that causes the game to attempt to increase your gold (i.e. sell an item, buy more than 9 items, etc)</plot>		<releasedate>29/9/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>SquareSoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<ESRB>T - Teen</ESRB>		<videoid>s6IG8NynXaA</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>3185</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563274-final-fantasy-legend-iii</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3185-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3185-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/b/e/gfs_3121_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/a/2/gfs_28961_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/2/gfs_28961_1_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/c/2/gfs_28961_1_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/d/2/gfs_28961_1_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/6/2/gfs_28961_1_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/b/2/gfs_28961_1_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/0/2/gfs_28961_1_7.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/d/3/gfs_28961_1_8.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/6/3/gfs_28961_1_9.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3185-1.jpg</fanart1>		<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3185-2.jpg</fanart2>		<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3185-g.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Sagaia (Japan)">		<description>Sagaia (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="E43DA090" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSagaia%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="79600F8602CA33F2B39A9B8D9824DFF55DFC1EF0" size="71970" />		<title_clean>Sagaia</title_clean>		<plot>Darius was once a planet that boasted a highly advanced civilization, but fell into ruin after succumbing to the relentless assaults of Belser and his mysterious space aliens.

It was released in the Arcades and was ported to various European home computers (which were published by Activision), the Game Boy and the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. The TG16 version was eventually ported to the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR]The player takes on the role of Tsukikage (Moon Shadow), the canine companion of a slain ninja. The dog takes on his master's form to avenge him by taking on an army of demonic ninja.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can press the select button at any time to switch between one of four weapons (the Righteous Cloud [katana], Swirling Leaf [shuriken], Bamboo Thunder [explosives], and Kusarigama [chain-scythe]). Each weapon can be aimed using the direction pad to attack forward, up, diagonally, and downward, and they can be powered up by collecting red orbs dropped by bright red ninja.[CR]In addition, the hero can multiply by collecting blue orbs dropped by the bright red ninja enemies. Up to two shadow ninja can appear at once, which copy the protagonist's every movement and attack, tripling his attack power. A pinkish orb kills all enemies on screen for a couple of seconds.[CR]The PC-Engine version port is the closest to its arcade counterpart and allows infinite continues as well as two difficulty settings: one where the player has 5 hit points, and another more difficult mode taken directly from the Arcade version where the protagonist is killed in one hit. Certain enemies still kill the hero in one hit regardless of which mode is played.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>6/7/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Bits Studios</studio>		<videoid>NDGDQfQ--4E</videoid>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569798-saigo-no-nindou-ninja-spirit</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-spirit/3030-11674/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2365560-tg16_ninjaspirit.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/9/6/306296_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/b/c/gfs_7802_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/6/c/gfs_7802_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/d/c/gfs_7802_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/2/1/gfs_7802_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/f/1/gfs_7802_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/4/1/gfs_7802_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/1/gfs_7802_2_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/9/5/gfs_7802_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Saint Paradise - Saikyou no Senshi-tachi (Japan)">		<description>Saint Paradise - Saikyou no Senshi-tachi (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="D6FE3C56" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSaint%20Paradise%20-%20Saikyou%20no%20Senshi-tachi%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E7CF9EABEAD0E5C0D3228871BB8219643E5BD7E0" size="160560" />		<title_clean>Saint Paradise - Saikyou no Senshi-tachi</title_clean>		<plot>Saint Paradise is a Role-Playing game, published by Bandai,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>13/11/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Bandai</studio>		<rating>6.5</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569737-saint-paradise</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/7/30387_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/7/30387_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/0/7/gfs_7370_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/9/a/gfs_7370_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/4/a/gfs_7370_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/f/a/gfs_7370_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/e/a/gfs_7370_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>	</game>	<game name="Sakigake!!

The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Samurai[CR]during the intro screen, wait until the close up of the fighter's eyes fades out, then when the screen switches to the fighter cutting down the trees, press Select four times.[CR]You should hear a chime if done correctly and there will be three extra samurai to choose from at the character select screen.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>TAKARA Co.</studio>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.7</rating>		<videoid>zPu1fBX2i08</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21719</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585886-samurai-shodown</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/samurai-shodown</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/samurai-shodown/3030-5692/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21719-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/257524-samurai-shodown-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/107307-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169370-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/107303-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-character-select-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/107304-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-charlotte-feels-the-power.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109657-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-victory-screen-showing.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/107305-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-ukyo-and-his-fast-action.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109662-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-jubei-execute-your-fast.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109661-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-tam-tam-s-skull-goes-in.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109659-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-each-character-has-a-small.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/109658-samurai-shodown-game-boy-screenshot-the-environment-a-peaceful.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Sangokushi - Game Boy Ban (Japan)">		<description>Sangokushi - Game Boy Ban (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="83706E92" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSangokushi%20-%20Game%20Boy%20Ban%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E94128D58341CAAEE595ED75292908A9AC5A466D" size="149791" />		<title_clean>Sangokushi - Game Boy Ban</title_clean>		<plot>San Goku Shi Game Boy Han is a Strategy game, developed by Koei/Inis and published by Koei,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>30/9/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Strategy, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Koei/Inis</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569788-san-goku-shi-game-boy-han</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/8/5/306285_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/8/5/306285_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/c/c/gfs_7424_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/c/gfs_7424_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/5/1/gfs_7424_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/8/1/gfs_7424_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Sanrio Carnival (Japan)">		<description>Sanrio Carnival (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="48D8AB7A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSanrio%20Carnival%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E17FA516E0F85C6DD80F29573363E42528D88266" size="32166" />		<title_clean>Sanrio Carnival</title_clean>		<plot>This is a pretty fun little game. You've probably seen this kind of thing before though. However, this is different because it's Sanrio, and Sanrio just kicks ass. :) Six Feet Under finished this in about three days, which makes sense, as there's not a whole lot to translate. Anyway, what you do is try to line up three blocks of the same type, and you can do this in either direction, even diagonal. The blocks come in twos, so some clever maneuvering is required to make that other block fall just where you want it after the first one is cleared. The game ranges from nice-n-fun to downright evil, as can be seen from the screenshots. Stick with the easy stuff, unless you enjoy having a headache.[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/45/[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/2000</releasedate>		<year>2000</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Scitron &amp; Art</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569704-sanrio-carnival</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/7/7/30377_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/c/3/gfs_8066_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/1/3/gfs_8066_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/e/gfs_8066_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/8/e/gfs_8066_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Sanrio Carnival 2 (Japan)">		<description>Sanrio Carnival 2 (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="758C7B2A" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSanrio%20Carnival%202%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="7FF76205C59CD090FDC91B2D8C57CB44FD4B009B" size="33116" />		<title_clean>Sanrio Carnival 2</title_clean>		<plot>Sanrio Carnival 2 is a Puzzle game, published by Character Soft, which was released in Japan in 1993.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/569828.html[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Puzzle</genre>		<studio>Character Soft</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569828-sanrio-carnival-2</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/5/0/296650_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/8/0/gfs_8067_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/1/d/gfs_8067_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/c/d/gfs_8067_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/7/d/gfs_8067_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Schiffe Versenken (Germany) (En,Fr,De,Es)">		<description>Schiffe Versenken (Germany) (En,Fr,De,Es)</description>		<rom crc="1CB8BFC2" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSchiffe%20Versenken%20%28Germany%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%29.zip" sha1="00745F75877423494679BBC3912E58238AC399C3" size="86641" />		<title_clean>Schiffe Versenken</title_clean>		<plot>Sea Battle is an adaptation of the pen-and-paper game "Battleship"/"Sea Battle".

Gaiden 2 adds four new characters, but is otherwise identical to the previous game. However, Gaiden 2 received an updated re-release named SD Hiryu no Ken EX that adds more options.[CR]Both games have a special border if they are used with a Super Game Boy; additionally, Vs. Mode can be played using two SFC/SNES controllers. However, the Super Game Boy runs Hiryu no Ken EX in monochrome mode which causes it to lose most of its color palette.[CR]SD Hiryu no Ken EX additions and changes[CR]Attack and Defend mode: A mode where one player is designated the Attacker, and the other is designated the Defender. The Attacker has ten seconds to inflict as much damage as they can. For the most part, the Defender can't attack, but some special techniques exist that allow the defender to strike the attacker, ending their turn early. After the turn is over, the roles of Attacker and Defender switch; this continues until a character is KO'd.Team mode: The player can choose to fight 2-on-2 battles in Circuit and A&amp;D modes. Health does not refill between rounds, and once the first player is knocked out, the next round starts with the second player.Survival mode: The player must defeat as many enemies as they can within a time limit.Perfect Challenge mode: Almost identical to Survival, except that the player has absolutely no health.Attack commands were modified; most unconventional motions were done away with, and half-circle-forward and half-circle-back moves only require the player to hit three directions (back-down-forward or forward-down-back, respectively).EX has dual-support for GB and GBC, while Gaiden 2 is always monochrome.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]RyuhiMin MinYukaHayatoShouryuUrukaEarthquakerWilerRosemanTetsuoMainohanaPowersRAIMAJenniferSuzakuNoelHelbertDavaRyumao[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>27/9/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action, Fighting, 2D</genre>		<studio>Culture Brain</studio>		<rating>6.0</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569974-sd-hiryu-no-ken-gaiden-2</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/sd-hiryu-no-ken-gaiden-2/3030-34433/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2651273-2847467788-30642.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/4/2/5/306425_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/2/8/gfs_9354_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/5/gfs_9354_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/5/gfs_9354_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/5/gfs_9354_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="SD Lupin Sansei -

When you're done entirely with that area, return to the house of Kondo's daughter, which is just one screen west of Omi Village's outside area. Speak with Kondo's daughter to get an unlimited supply of ladders![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]Normally, throughout the course of the game, you will be forced to only obtain one Water Spider from the Geko Castle area, with the rest of them (as many dungeons require multiple Water Spiders) being dropped on rare occasions by enemies. There is a way to make sure your supply, however, is unlimited, greatly making your journey easier. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]When you discover the secret in the Wind Scroll, head to Geko Castle and into the southeastern well's cave. Soon, you will come to an area (the seventh screen total) where there is a backwards-"L" protrusion from the northern wall. Go north from this screen to the next. (The spikes you see blocking the way are some you can walk on, at least the westernmost two sets.) In the next area, go northwest and use a Water Spider to cross the river there. Then go east from the treasure chest you find and navigate through the spikes as you did with the entrance to this area (some are fake). Cross the river again when next possible, then cross the river one more time when that path ends. Go north and west from there, past some more fake spikes, to the staircase. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Unlimited Ladders[CR]This will lead to an otherwise-inaccessible passage in the ninja master's house. Go south from where you appear and you will go through the wall. Speak with him and he will allow you to have an unlimited supply of Water Spiders![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Defense-Boosting Pickups[CR]Note that this trick can only be executed when you obtain the consumable version (i.e. the one you actually use) of the Offering item. Head to the unnamed village you first visited near the very start of the game, then go one screen east of there. In the southern portion of that area is a mushroom statue - use the Offering on that statue to create a bridge. That bridge will take you to a portion of the area where an enemy will continually reappear upon its death and will almost always drop heart-emblazoned pickups, which are used to boost your defense and thus lessen the damage you take.</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>RPG, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>NMK</studio>		<rating>9.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21685</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585835-ninja-taro</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21685-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/3/gfs_38675_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/3/gfs_38675_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/b/3/gfs_38675_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/3/gfs_81952_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/e/gfs_38675_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/e/gfs_38675_2_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/2/e/gfs_38675_2_3.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/3/e/gfs_38675_2_4.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/8/e/gfs_38675_2_5.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/e/gfs_38675_2_6.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Sensible Soccer - European Champions (Europe)">		<description>Sensible Soccer - European Champions (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="BD022658" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSensible%20Soccer%20-%20European%20Champions%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="EB9F0C6D3C137BE7991E9D28FE48D5026BEB2F35" size="58650" />		<title_clean>Sensible Soccer - European Champions</title_clean>		<plot>Sensible Soccer: European Champions is a Sports game, developed by Sensible Software and published by Sony Imagesoft,which was released in Europe in 1993.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Sony Imagesoft</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>24119</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/638957-sensible-soccer-european-champions</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24119-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/9/5/201395_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/1/2/gfs_223123_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/c/2/gfs_223123_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/7/2/gfs_223123_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/6/2/gfs_223123_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/d/2/gfs_223123_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/2/gfs_223123_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/b/2/gfs_223123_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/8/f/gfs_223123_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/5/f/gfs_223123_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/e/f/gfs_223123_2_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Serpent (USA)">		<description>Serpent (USA)</description>		<rom crc="74D466D7" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSerpent%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="3122B3C12C2580C3A81D70C5648F767BF3590AAF" size="20733" />		<title_clean>Serpent</title_clean>		<plot>In the distant future, the most popular one-on-one sport is Serpent.

If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.[CR]Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy. Since Shanghai uses the same tileset as Mahjong and it is a one-player game, it is often called Mahjong Solitaire.[CR]This particular version was created in the late-80s and ported to various systems courtesy of Activision. Sunsoft is credited as responsible for the Famicom version, which was only available in Japan.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New Features[CR]Start up a new game, then press Select (which will take you to the options menu).

Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. [CR]A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. [CR]Some variants are also included:[CR]1. Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.[CR]2. Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score. [CR]3. Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'.

The game is set around the tournament scene and gets progressively more difficult as the player goes from venue to venue, eventually entering a global competition.[CR]The WonderSwan version is the last game that Data East released before their bankruptcy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls like many pool simulators (as well as several golf simulators of the time) by allowing the player to select which direction they wish to hit the cue ball in, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory, and then they must tap a button to start the power gauge and tap it again to stop at the desired level of power. The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.[CR]Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.[CR]Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Simulation, Sports</genre>		<studio>Data East USA</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.8</rating>		<videoid>x-lzif50eWw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21724</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585891-side-pocket</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/side-pocket</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/side-pocket/3030-2042/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21724-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/206701-side-pocket-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253248-side-pocket-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119879-side-pocket-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/151272-side-pocket-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/116138-side-pocket-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168190-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168177-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-game-selection.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168178-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-9-ball-game-start-when-preparing.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168179-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-a-maximum-power-strike-leading.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168180-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-free-ball-means-you-can-place.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168181-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-your-current-status-during.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168182-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-the-results-at-the-ending.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168183-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-pocket-game-class-board.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168184-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-sinking-a-ball-in-the-pocket.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168185-side-pocket-game-boy-screenshot-by-sinking-at-the-star-you.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Simpsons Itchy &amp; Scratchy, The - Miniature Golf Madness (USA, Europe)">		<description>Simpsons Itchy &amp; Scratchy, The - Miniature Golf Madness (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="DDB147E5" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSimpsons%20Itchy%20%26%20Scratchy%2C%20The%20-%20Miniature%20Golf%20Madness%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="1DBB3EB39E0A2D695136880E6DD0557EB48EBF21" size="96588" />		<title_clean>Simpsons Itchy &amp; Scratchy, The - Miniature Golf Madness</title_clean>		<plot>Itchy &amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness is a Sports game, developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim,which was released in 1994.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various Cheats[CR]All 3 cheats are to be entered on the Title Screen, you will hear a confirmation sound when done correctly.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Sports, Miscellaneous, Arcade</genre>		<studio>Beam Software</studio>		<videoid>e65LwnqGqhE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18671</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585756-itchy-and-scratchy-in-miniature-golf-madness</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18671-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/9/7/gfs_38625_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/4/7/gfs_38625_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/0/a/gfs_38625_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/d/a/gfs_38625_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Simpsons, The - Bart &amp; the Beanstalk (USA, Europe)">		<description>Simpsons, The - Bart &amp; the Beanstalk (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="517A614C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSimpsons%2C%20The%20-%20Bart%20%26%20the%20Beanstalk%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="98A2D90717D8C9F7FEB2D7653AAAB6FAA0F3EE64" size="69363" />		<title_clean>Simpsons, The - Bart &amp; the Beanstalk</title_clean>		<plot>The Simpsons: Bart &amp; the Beanstalk is a retelling of the English fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk with Simpsons characters.[CR]Bart Simpson is sent to trade the Simpsons' last cow for some food and he ends up trading it to Monty Burns for some magic beans and a slingshot.

The game is a                parody of the television show               American Gladiators. The game consists of seven different events which showcase a variety of locations from the show and include several other characters from the show.[CR]Events[CR]Dr. Marvin Monroe's Hop, Skip and FryThe first event is a makeshift game of              basketball where          Bart must score baskets against the Juggernauts while avoiding electrified panels on the floor.Captain Murdock's Skateboard Bash and CrashHere, Bart starts at the top of a             giant ramp and skateboards down it, attempting to gain enough speed while avoiding obstacles to clear the gap and knock the Juggernaut on the other side off his post.Nuclear Power Plant Bop `Till You DropThis event takes place in the            nuclear plant where           Homer works and places both Bart and a Juggernaut on separate platforms over a pit of nuclear waste.  The goal of this event is to knock off the Juggernaut using padded batons. Moe's Tavern Shove FestBart is found at Moe's         bar and must engage a female juggernaut and Barny Gumbel in a good old fashioned shove match.  The last man (or woman) on the mat is the winner.Herman&#8217;s Military Minefield MayhemNext Bart is forced to       parachute past a flurry of flying knives and navigate a    mine field covered in  bared wire in an obstacle course from   hell.The Krustyland Hammer SlammerIn this event, Bart must attempt to knock the Juggernauts from their platforms by taking a running start and hitting the tower hard enough to sound the bell at the top and send the Juggernauts to the ground.The Kwik-E-Mart Doggie DodgeBart finds himself in the Kwik-E-Mart and must run around the level gathering food items while avoid rabid dogs that are chasing him.  After collecting enough food, Bart must make a dash to the      cash register to complete the challenge.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>RfT_Ff7tERs</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21725</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585895-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts/3030-9730/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8616</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21725-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/73919-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30303-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147922-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25424-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25425-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-your.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25426-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-event.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25427-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-skateboard.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25428-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-hop.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25429-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-shove.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/25430-the-simpsons-bart-vs-the-juggernauts-game-boy-screenshot-radioactive.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/e/gfs_38713_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/e/gfs_38713_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/e/gfs_38713_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/iLEgTKl.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Skate or Die - Bad 'N Rad (USA)">		<description>Skate or Die - Bad 'N Rad (USA)</description>		<rom crc="4DB7C817" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSkate%20or%20Die%20-%20Bad%20%27N%20Rad%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="6A128648584AE17AC6DEE5A2BDBA10B0BB220434" size="75388" />		<title_clean>Skate or Die - Bad 'N Rad</title_clean>		<plot>Skate Or Die: Bad'N Rad is a Jump'N Run that consists of 7 levels, three of which are viewed from a top-down perspective. The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump'N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action, Sports</genre>		<studio>Konami</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>18677</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585898-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/skate-or-die-bad-n-rad</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/skate-or-die-bad-n-rad/3030-5589/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13508</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2181146-cover.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56272-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56273-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/116146-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97306-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97307-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-stage-select.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97308-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-stage-1-defeating.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97309-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-the-first-boss-to.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97310-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-the-second-stage.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97311-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-caught-by-a-fisherman.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97312-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-in-the-sewers-you.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97313-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-and-nasty-divers.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97314-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-stage-4-driving.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/97315-skate-or-die-bad-n-rad-game-boy-screenshot-chased-by-a-giant.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/9meoHsd.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Skate or Die - Tour de Thrash (USA)">		<description>Skate or Die - Tour de Thrash (USA)</description>		<rom crc="02B77C09" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSkate%20or%20Die%20-%20Tour%20de%20Thrash%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="6E1610450DA0C836983A1C310524639FEFCC304F" size="72382" />		<title_clean>Skate or Die - Tour de Thrash</title_clean>		<plot>[CR]Though this is the second Skate or Die game to appear on the Game Boy, it is the first done by Electronic Arts, the developer of the original game in the series.

The game is a mix of platforming and third-person combat, with the player being able to jump and traverse ledges in the platforming sections, and fight using Archer's crossbow and 13 other weapons when in combat. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who will then join you in battle against the Commandos. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer modes where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.[CR]Characters [CR]Gorgonites:Archer[CR] Gorgonites leader, who uses his arm as a cross bow, considered the most bravest out of all the Gorgonites.

When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.[CR]Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it.  To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit.  You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Tradewest</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.4</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21730</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585899-sneaky-snakes</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/sneaky-snakes</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/sneaky-snakes/3030-8795/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21730-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/99108-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175850-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175851-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-each-level-starts-you-at.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175852-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-these-mushrooms-can-be-hopped.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175853-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-warps-often-take-you-to.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175854-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-don-t-stay-in-the-water.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175855-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-these-machines-are-nibbley.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175856-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-stand-on-the-scales-to-ring.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175857-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-after-each-level-the-amount.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175858-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-the-balloons-can-be-difficult.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175859-sneaky-snakes-game-boy-screenshot-your-snake-will-fall-off.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Snoopy -

The game has 6 levels ranging from space environments, atmospheric reentry, alien cities, wastelands, and finally the outer and inner core of the enemy's base.  Certain capsules will contain   power-ups which will upgrade your firepower.  The first power-up collected will allow you to fire 2 shots at once, collect 2 more power-ups and you may shoot 3 shots at once, collect 2 power-ups again and you will fire 2 diamond-shaped projectiles which are the most powerful weapon in the game.  The game features dozens of enemy types with different attacks and movement patterns, as well as screen-filling boss monsters and mini bosses.  An remastered version of the first and second levels' background music was featured on several episodes of the Captain N cartoon show.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beat level 1 boss w\o shooting[CR]When you start to hear the Boss music on level one, go to the right hand corner, eventually, the boss will just get bored and leave the screen.

Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game&#8217;s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).[CR]Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player&#8217;s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their &#8220;invasion.&#8221; As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).[CR]The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or &#8220;bunkers&#8221; near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a &#8220;mystery ship&#8221; will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinet[CR]Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.[CR]In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[CR]It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game&#8217;s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins&#8212;and subsequent production increase&#8212;in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 version[CR]The 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).[CR]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to simulate already-existing things," Space Invaders was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[CR]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[CR]It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.[CR]Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a &#8220;high score,&#8221; and was the first to save the player&#8217;s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari&#8217;s Asteroids, Williams&#8217; Defender, and Namco&#8217;s Galaxian series.[CR]It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequels[CR]Recent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>9BJmtCCvx_Y</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21237</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585905-space-invaders</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/space-invaders_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/space-invaders/3030-5099/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5438</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/139866/2602658-28031001.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154716-space-invaders-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103535-space-invaders-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186516-space-invaders-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218758-space-invaders-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/671390-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/671391-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-score-table.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/671392-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-game-mode-selection.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/671393-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122675-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-selecting-the-game-mode.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122676-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-super-game.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122673-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-score-table-super-game.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122674-space-invaders-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-favorite-screen.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/8/d/gfs_76449_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/d/gfs_76449_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/bnBsCxR.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Spanky's Quest (USA)">		<description>Spanky's Quest (USA)</description>		<rom crc="6EE7CA79" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpanky%27s%20Quest%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="8F448EAB7E6A05266D62F3564A00813F79314736" size="44987" />		<title_clean>Spanky's Quest</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spanky's Quest is a 2D puzzle platformer developed by Natsume and published by Taito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1992.[CR]Originally released in Japan in December 27, 1991 (as Hansei Zaru Jirou-kun no Daibouken, translated to Monkey Reflections: The Adventures of Mr. Jiro), players control an anthropomorphic monkey kid (named Spanky), who must journey through six towers to defeat an evil witch and return home. To do this, he must unlock doors (with keys found scattered throughout levels) while eliminating hostile anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables by various sports balls conjured by popping colored bubbles thrown by him. He can also collect hats (as single-level powerups) which grant different abilities.[CR]The handheld version, released for the Game Boy, was originally released in Japan (as Lucky Monkey) on April 26, 1991 (and released in North America at the same time as the SNES version). Unlike the SNES version, there are no keys or hats to pick up (and the concept of attacking with sports balls was changed to "bubble blasts"). However, players can collect bonus pickups (giving more score, collected for each enemy eliminated) and special "letter" pickups (either S, P, A, N, K, or Y, collected by eliminating more than one enemy with the same bubble blast). Collecting each of the six pickups immediately sends the player to the bonus stage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Enter the following password to enter the Sound Test:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following password to go to the desired stage:</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Natsume</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21735</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585906-spankys-quest</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/spankys-quest_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/spankys-quest/3030-5944/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1845431-box_squest.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224462-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/224463-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176677-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-european-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183857-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-japanese-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176697-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-american-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176679-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-choose-tower.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176681-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-spanky-s-tail-can-be-very.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176682-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-bouncing-the-boll.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176683-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-got-a-letter.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176684-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-ball-gets-bigger.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176685-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-the-ball-explodes.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/176686-spanky-s-quest-game-boy-screenshot-happy-monkey.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Spartan X (Japan)">		<description>Spartan X (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="CA7B4229" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpartan%20X%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="E2319966EA5EBB99DB6F6178BB927DC1C7F734B2" size="33330" />		<title_clean>Spartan X</title_clean>		<plot>Kung Fu Master is an Action game, developed and published by Irem,which was released in Japan in 1990.</plot>		<releasedate>14/2/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action, Beat-Em-Up</genre>		<studio>Irem</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>4.5</rating>		<videoid>LZ-73SmqLwc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18862</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585782-kung-fu-master</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18862-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/18862-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/0/c/gfs_3266_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/d/gfs_91510_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/b/d/gfs_91510_1_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/d/gfs_91510_1_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/9/1/gfs_3266_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/f/0/gfs_91510_2_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/2/0/gfs_91510_2_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/9/0/gfs_91510_2_3.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/8/0/gfs_91510_2_4.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/3/0/gfs_91510_2_5.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (USA, Europe)">		<description>Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="FD06E22D" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpeedball%202%20-%20Brutal%20Deluxe%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="9EC7EF7F362CDA3C28A727D2D8A8458FFD80CDA0" size="78050" />		<title_clean>Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.[CR]Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.[CR]Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp Gates[CR]There are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.[CR]Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.[CR]Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.[CR]Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.[CR]In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.[CR]In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.[CR]At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.[CR]The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.[CR]Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/10/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action, Sports</genre>		<studio>Mindscape</studio>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>0.0</rating>		<videoid>YKRphdcclsg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21736</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585907-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe/3030-289/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21736-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/2/1/46721_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85504-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85505-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85506-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-manager-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85507-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-game-on.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85508-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-fighting-for.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85509-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-the-shame-of.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85510-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-gooooooaaaaaaal.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/85511-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-game-boy-screenshot-victory-is-ours.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/1/8/gfs_38720_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/c/8/gfs_38720_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Speedy Gonzales (USA, Europe)">		<description>Speedy Gonzales (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="27CDE8D6" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpeedy%20Gonzales%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="805BE36B4701DDA53B967C0153B9BFCC2C059F75" size="152922" />		<title_clean>Speedy Gonzales</title_clean>		<plot>Speedy Gonzales is a platform game in which the player controls the Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzales.[CR]The player can run in the side-scrolling levels.

Controls for jumping, punching, and web slinging are similar, but now Spider-Man can pick up objects that allow him to perform certain actions.

A password feature is also present and two-player capabilities utilizing the Game Boy Link cable.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Malibu Games</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>5.0</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>24124</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585914-sports-illustrated-golf-classic</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/sports-illustrated-golf-classic</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24124-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/3/9/46739_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/457895-sports-illustrated-golf-classic-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/457896-sports-illustrated-golf-classic-game-boy-screenshot-golfer.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/457897-sports-illustrated-golf-classic-game-boy-screenshot-country.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/457899-sports-illustrated-golf-classic-game-boy-screenshot-first.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/457900-sports-illustrated-golf-classic-game-boy-screenshot-the-hole.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/9/8/gfs_49835_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/4/8/gfs_49835_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/0/5/gfs_49835_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/d/5/gfs_49835_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/6/5/gfs_49835_2_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Sports Illustrated for Kids - The Ultimate Triple Dare!

The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.[CR]When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Arcadia Systems</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>2.2</rating>		<videoid>fe2dJNYlJyU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18590</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585916-spot-the-video-game</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/spot</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18590-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57570-spot-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57571-spot-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/225743-spot-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/225744-spot-game-boy-screenshot-demo.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/225745-spot-game-boy-screenshot-i-m-losing.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/1/gfs_38727_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/0/1/gfs_38727_1_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/4/5/gfs_3108_2_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/4/c/gfs_38727_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>	</game>	<game name="Spot - The Cool Adventure (USA)">		<description>Spot - The Cool Adventure (USA)</description>		<rom crc="76F67428" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpot%20-%20The%20Cool%20Adventure%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="BCC923E6E73EFE7E865625BB6ECF2EF08E380826" size="87473" />		<title_clean>Spot - The Cool Adventure</title_clean>		<plot>Spot: The Cool Adventure is an Action game, developed by Visual Concepts and published by Ocean,which was released in Europe in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>14/1/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action, Platform, 2D</genre>		<studio>Visual Concepts</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>DCBaVMUMja8</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18589</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585917-spot-the-cool-adventure</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/spot-the-cool-adventure</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/spot-in-the-cool-adventures/3030-34772/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2166808-box_tcsa.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/4/6/46746_back.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/212581-spot-the-cool-adventure-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/499924-spot-the-cool-adventure-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/5/b/gfs_34173_1_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/8/b/gfs_34173_1_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/3/b/gfs_34173_1_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/2/b/gfs_34173_1_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/9/b/gfs_34173_1_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/4/b/gfs_34173_1_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/9/6/gfs_81860_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/4/6/gfs_81860_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/f/6/gfs_81860_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Spud's Adventure (USA)">		<description>Spud's Adventure (USA)</description>		<rom crc="70E5ED99" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSpud%27s%20Adventure%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="556F6BF41D671A80B0B71D5897C4D8A6FFC7B5B1" size="43103" />		<title_clean>Spud's Adventure</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Spud's Adventure is an action-adventure-puzzle game released by Atlus for the Game Boy in 1991.

The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.[CR]On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.[CR]Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.[CR]The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired level: </plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Absolute Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21742</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585921-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus/3030-1878/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4656/922352-star_trek_nexus.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154726-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/84512-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/158947-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152856-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218455-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218456-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218457-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218458-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218459-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218460-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218461-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218462-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/218463-star-trek-generations-beyond-the-nexus-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Star Wars (USA, Europe) (Rev A)">		<description>Star Wars (USA, Europe) (Rev A)</description>		<rom crc="5D8DEB5B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FStar%20Wars%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28Rev%20A%29.zip" sha1="F6563F526FC786C8666D75DFBA9E6D42D787EA89" size="80292" />		<title_clean>Star Wars</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of  Luke Skywalker, driving the  landspeeder across  Tatooine in search of  R2-D2.   Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the "Cantina Band" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.   The player eventually lands on the  Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the  Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once  Alderaan, and shooting down  Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an  X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown. The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker,  Han Solo,  Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature  Darth Vader or  Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through Asteroid Belt with no damage[CR]When you are going through the asteroid belt after beating the level in the bottom left corner of the map, stay on the bottom of the far left side, or the bottom of the far right side to fly through the asteroid belt without having to get damage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get Han Solo[CR]To play as Han Solo go to Mos Eisley on Tatooine and enter the cantina using the up button.

The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of  Luke Skywalker, driving the  landspeeder across  Tatooine in search of  R2-D2.   Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the "Cantina Band" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.   The player eventually lands on the  Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the  Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once  Alderaan, and shooting down  Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an  X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown. The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker,  Han Solo,  Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature  Darth Vader or  Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through Asteroid Belt with no damage[CR]When you are going through the asteroid belt after beating the level in the bottom left corner of the map, stay on the bottom of the far left side, or the bottom of the far right side to fly through the asteroid belt without having to get damage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get Han Solo[CR]To play as Han Solo go to Mos Eisley on Tatooine and enter the cantina using the up button.

Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.[CR]There are two game modes building on this basic concept:[CR]1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.[CR]Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>0.2</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>23342</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585924-stargate</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/stargate__</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/stargate/3030-8853/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23342-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/23342-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103539-stargate-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/158964-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/158965-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387020-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-skill-mode-has-you-trying-to.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387019-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-all-tiles-have-two-sides-and.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387021-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-battle-mode-offers-some-limited.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387022-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-battle-mode-adds-some-map-conquest.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387023-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-you-re-fighting-ra-and-his-minions.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/387024-stargate-game-boy-screenshot-battle-mode-moves-cleared-tiles.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/a/0/gfs_38732_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/7/0/gfs_38732_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Stop That Roach!

The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.[CR]The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.[CR]The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. [CR]There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock both cups in championship mode[CR]At the main screen go down and select options, go down to the password entry and enter a code in and push start</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</studio>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>2.8</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21608</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585928-street-racer</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/street-racer</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/street-racer/3030-22190/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2364797-snes_streetracer_au.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/2/4/7724_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142153-street-racer-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142154-street-racer-game-boy-screenshot-choosing-a-pilot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142155-street-racer-game-boy-screenshot-race-grid.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/5/3/gfs_56947_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/c/e/gfs_56947_2_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/1/e/gfs_56947_2_2.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/a/e/gfs_56947_2_3.jpg</snapshot7>	</game>	<game name="Sumo Fighter (USA)">		<description>Sumo Fighter (USA)</description>		<rom crc="BADC7CEE" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSumo%20Fighter%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="48F225F86985D5FB09877E028BAAD8A6F3EE8D95" size="78018" />		<title_clean>Sumo Fighter</title_clean>		<plot>Sumo Fighter is a 2D Fighting game, developed by Kid and published by DTMC, which was released in 1993.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/585929.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Mode[CR]At the Title Screen press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, Right.

The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/garry-kitchens-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Absolute Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21745</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585930-super-battletank</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/super-battletank</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21745-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145940-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-gear-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/194241-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-gear-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/208583-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-genesis-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154288-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-snes-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/212269-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-snes-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428922-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428923-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428924-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428925-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428926-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428927-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428928-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428929-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428930-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/428931-garry-kitchen-s-super-battletank-war-in-the-gulf-game-boy.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Super Bikkuriman - Densetsu no Sekiban (Japan)">		<description>Super Bikkuriman - Densetsu no Sekiban (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="C1E1A041" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuper%20Bikkuriman%20-%20Densetsu%20no%20Sekiban%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="B7DAC857947FCE1069145A1F5D560C26AA3C8F42" size="108478" />		<title_clean>Super Bikkuriman - Densetsu no Sekiban</title_clean>		<plot>Super BikkuriMan is an Action game, developed by Tom Create and published by Yutaka,which was released in Japan in 1992.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Move the dark piece to the following place:</plot>		<releasedate>11/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Tom Create</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569776-super-bikkuriman</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/super-bikkuriman-densetsu-no-sekiban/3030-40730/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2381002-569776_7822_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/1/gfs_7822_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/5/1/gfs_7822_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/1/c/gfs_7822_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/c/c/gfs_7822_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Super Black Bass (USA)">		<description>Super Black Bass (USA)</description>		<rom crc="6B497842" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuper%20Black%20Bass%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="4D3CB96DA714D785DFBCC3BA242F9A7A221C9CBB" size="237717" />		<title_clean>Super Black Bass</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Black Bass is the first SNES game in Hot B's series of fishing simulators, most of which contain Black Bass in the title.

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.[CR]However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal.

A handheld successor to Super Mario Bros., it is one of the launch titles for the Game Boy, developed with no input from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto (instead developed from Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's R&amp;D1 devision).[CR]Players control hero plumber Mario as he ventures through the four tropical kingdoms of Sarasaland to rescue Princess Daisy (and the hypnotized inhabitants of the lands) from mysterious space monster Tatanga.[CR]The game would receive a direct sequel in 1992, titled Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, which vastly improves upon the platforming aspects of the original while adding a new adversary, Wario (who would play as the protagonist in the series spin-off, Wario Land). Tatanga returns in this sequel (as a boss), while Daisy later becomes a regular in Mario spin-off games (starting with Mario Tennis). Super Mario Land was later released for the Nintendo 3DS (via Virtual Console) on June 6, 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario Land is a standard sidescrolling platformer (in similar vein to Super Mario Bros.) where players must guide Mario through 12 levels (split into four unique areas, called "Worlds"), to reach each level's goal (at the rightmost part). Players move Mario using left and right on the d-pad, while holding the "B" button to run and hitting the "A" button to jump.[CR]Like Super Mario Bros., Mario is vulnerable to touching most enemies and their projectiles. If he gets hit once (while not powered-up), falls off the level, or gets trapped in automatic side-scrolling stages, he loses a life and must restart the level. If the player loses all of his lives, then he must either use a continue (and restart the level with three lives and no score) or end the game with a game over. Mario can knock out most enemies by jumping (or falling) on them, gaining points by doing so.[CR]Scattered around all levels are coins which can be collected by touching them. Coins can also be found by hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels) from below. For every 100 coins collected, the player earns an extra life. For every 100,000 points earned, the player earns an extra continue.[CR]The end of most levels contain two exits, one of which is located at the top of the screen and is more difficult to access. If Mario reaches the higher exit, then the player is rewarded with a mini-game in which players can earn a Fire Flower power-up or up to three extra lives.Power-ups[CR]By hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels), players can find special power-ups which grant Mario special abilities.Super Mushroom - Transforms Mario into Super Mario, giving him a taller stature while allowing Mario to get hit once without losing a life.Fire Flower - Only appears if Mario is Super Mario. If Mario is no longer Super Mario before touching one, it automatically applies the Super Mushroom power-up. Mario also has the ability to throw "superballs" (by tapping the B button), which bounce off surfaces and knock out most enemies.Starman - Grants Mario temporary invincibility (as indicated by a change in background music and Mario's clothes flickering). Mario can still lose a life by falling off the level or getting trapped in automatic side-scrolling levels.VehiclesIn some stages, Mario can pilot a personal vehicle, such as the Marine Pop above.[CR]In certain levels, Mario pilots a personal vehicle in an automatic side-scrolling level. While in the vehicles, Mario moves around the stage with the d-pad while shooting torpedoes or missiles with either A or B buttons.[CR]During these levels, the screen scrolls right automatically up to the level's boss battle. If Mario gets trapped between the left edge of the level and an object, he automatically loses a life and must restart the level.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game has 12 stages, all split up into four themed "worlds". The player progresses through each world in order, defeating a boss at the third stage of each world.Birabuto Kingdom - An Ancient Egyptian-themed world. The second stage takes place on top of giant palm trees while the third stage takes place inside a pyramid. The boss of this world is King Totomesu, a large sphinx creature that jumps and spits fireballs at Mario.Muda Kingdom - A water-themed world. In the third stage, which is underwater, Mario pilots his personal submarine (the Marine Pop). The boss of this world is Dragonzamasu, a large seahorse creature that swims around and spits fireballs at Mario.Easton Kingdom - An island-themed world. The second stage takes place in a cavern. The boss of this world is Hiyoihoi, a moai head creature that throws large rocks at Mario.Chai Kingdom - An Ancient China-themed world. In the third stage, which is in the sky, Mario pilots is personal aircraft (the Sky Pop). The boss of this world is Biokinton, a cloud creature that throws flying birds at Mario. After defeating it, Tatanga appears with his spacecraft as the final boss fight.[CR]By clearing all twelve levels, players can replay the game in "Expert Mode", where enemies are moved around in each stage to make the stages more difficult. Clearing the harder levels allows players to replay any of the game's levels.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]When you beat the game, press any button while you're on the title screen. The cursor will change from a mushroom to Mario's face. Press Start to play the new Expert Mode that features enemies that are more difficult, more numerous, and in different places.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]Normally, during the invincibility granted by the Star, each enemy you knock off the screen will be worth 100 pts. However, when you pump a Super Ball into an enemy that is worth 400 or 800, each enemy the Star kills after that will be worth the same amount! This works with torpedoes (submarine) and missiles (airplane) as well. With enemies that require more than one projectile to be slain, one hit is still enough to get this trick to work.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]If you go through stage 1-3 normally there will be coins and pipes on the top of the stage that you can't access. To access them you need to activate two secret elevators.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]The first one is right at the start of the stage. Position Mario exactly three blocks away from the left side of the screen. Jump and lean against the wall and there's your first elevator. Stand ontop of the block and don't move. You will go straight through the top blocks and Mario will be on the top of the screen where your stats are.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]The second elevator is at the second lion. Kill the lion and dodge the two falling stones. There will be a row of five blocks that go in a pattern of coins and bricks. Break the second brick with Super or Superball Mario. Jump through the hole you just made and the second elevator will appear. There will be no coins this time, but it will lead you to a secret pipe. In expert mode a plant enemy will be there so watch out.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]In level 2-2, when you see a tall line of vertical coins near a pipe and a Nokobon, get hit so you shrink (if you're Super or Superball Mario).  Ahead of you are two levels, but the lower one seems out of reach.  There is an invisible floor that makes it accessible, but you must be Little Mario to walk across it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]Beat the game two times in a row, then keep pressing A. Pressing A after completing the game twice in a row activates a Stage Select. The more times you press A, the higher the stage you can go to.

Wario put's an evil spell over Mario Land, making the inhabitants think that Wario is their leader. He then seals the door of Mario's castle and takes the six golden coins that hold it shut and scatters them across the land. The objective of the game is to get all six coins and enter the castle to confront Wario.[CR]This is the first game in Nintendo history to feature Wario, that lout.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game generally plays like any Mario platformer would, with some interesting exceptions. Mario proceeds from left to right in his search for the exit to the next stage. Once he reaches this exit, he will discover a bell hanging above it. To reach this bell usually takes some extra effort, but if he manages to ring it he will be taken to a mini-game where he can earn powerups and extra lives, assuming he doesn't accidentally walk off the screen before he's awarded the prize.Bunny Mario, we hardly knew ye. Note kill counter and coin counter that exceeds 99 coins.[CR]New to the Mario series, and never seen again afterward, is Bunny Mario. After eating a Super Carrot, Mario transforms into Bunny Mario and can glide by twitching his ears up and down. Bunny Mario cannot fly technically, he can only slow his descent as Bunny Mario, similar to the glide effect given by the racoon and tanooki suits in other SMB games. Why this change was never later used is unknown, but at least you get to ponder how rabbit ears could possibly help Mario take to the skies.[CR]Mario selects worlds from a map, taking each world on in any order. The map has six different zones, each with 3-4 levels in them. There's the Tree Zone, Space Zone, Macro Zone, Pumpkin Zone, Mario Zone and Turtle Zone.[CR]In an interesting change, instead of a 100 coin counter, the coin counter goes up to 999, and doesn't roll over to zero or give you extra lives. The coins are used in a special zone where you play a game of chance to try to win awards, including fire flowers, bunny ears, extra lives, recovered coins, and a booby prize in the form of a witch, who gives you nothing. it is also possible to accidentally pick up more witches in certain areas, and these witches will be added to the minigame board, increasing the chance that you'll get nothing for the coins you risked.[CR]There is another counter, which goes up to 99, but this is a KILL counter, and when THAT reaches 100 kills, you are awarded with an invincibility star no matter where you are in the stage. This can potentially lead to more extra lives if you can kill enough enemies in combination before the invincibility runs out, and because it can occur anywhere on the stage, it can suddenly be very helpful in getting past certain areas (or it can be all but useless, depending on your timing).[CR]Another interesting fact is that this game is one of the few Mario games to feature a multi-stage boss that takes a total of more than 3 hits. In a sense, it's a combination of 3 successive bosses that total 9 hits, creating a bit of tension when you realize that you have a ways to go before you win.[CR]Zone Overview[CR]Turtle Zone - Consists of three water themed levels. When Mario first enters the zone he gets swallowed by a giant turtle. The boss at the end of the zone is an octopus.[CR]Mario Zone - The zone looks like a giant toy Mario. Its four levels have a toy theme to them. The bosses at the end of the zone are The Three Little Pigs.[CR]Pumpkin Zone - All four of the levels feature a scary theme. The zone looks like a giant pumpkin. The boss at the end of the zone is a witch.[CR]Space Zone - This zone consists of three space themed levels. To get to this zone you must first beat a level that looks like a giant hippo on the map screen. In these levels, gravity is much lighter and Mario's jumps take him much farther. He also wears a space suit in all of the levels. The boss at the end of the zone is the alien Tatanga, the final boss from the first Mario Land game.[CR]Macro Zone - For this zone Mario shrinks to a small size while he enters a normal house. It consists of four levels. The boss at the end of the zone is a giant rat.[CR]Tree Zone - This zone consists of four levels set in a gigantic tree. All the levels are tree based on different parts of the tree. The boss at the end of the zone is a crow.[CR]Final Zone - This zone takes place inside Mario's Castle which has been warped to suit Wario's needs. The boss at the end of the zone is Wario himself who must be defeated three times. The first time he attacks he runs back and forth across the screen and slams into the ground dropping a light from the ceiling to try and hit you. After three hits, he escapes off screen. He then attacks as Bunny Wario. In this form, he leaps to the top of the screen and flys back and forth while slowly descending before slamming into the ground dropping the light and freezing you in place for a second or two. After another three hits he escapes one final time. He then transforms into Fire Wario. He attacks by running back and forth and shooting fireballs at you. After the final three hits he turns into Baby Wario and is defeated.[CR]3DS Version[CR]It was announced for a Q4 2011 release on the 3DS Virtual Console.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Mode[CR]Enter the appropriate code for Easy Mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Preventing Yourself From Losing A Life[CR]When you're about to lose a life, whether by getting hit by an enemy/obstacle or fall into the void, pause just when Mario about to leave the screen and then reset the game.

Wario put's an evil spell over Mario Land, making the inhabitants think that Wario is their leader. He then seals the door of Mario's castle and takes the six golden coins that hold it shut and scatters them across the land. The objective of the game is to get all six coins and enter the castle to confront Wario.[CR]This is the first game in Nintendo history to feature Wario, that lout.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game generally plays like any Mario platformer would, with some interesting exceptions. Mario proceeds from left to right in his search for the exit to the next stage. Once he reaches this exit, he will discover a bell hanging above it. To reach this bell usually takes some extra effort, but if he manages to ring it he will be taken to a mini-game where he can earn powerups and extra lives, assuming he doesn't accidentally walk off the screen before he's awarded the prize.Bunny Mario, we hardly knew ye.

After eating a Super Carrot, Mario transforms into Bunny Mario and can glide by twitching his ears up and down. Bunny Mario cannot fly technically, he can only slow his descent as Bunny Mario, similar to the glide effect given by the racoon and tanooki suits in other SMB games. Why this change was never later used is unknown, but at least you get to ponder how rabbit ears could possibly help Mario take to the skies.[CR]Mario selects worlds from a map, taking each world on in any order.

It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.[CR]The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.[CR] [CR]</plot>		<releasedate>8/3/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Board Game</genre>		<studio>Hudson</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569711-super-momotarou-dentetsu</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/super-momotarou-dentetsu/3030-32742/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2453/1529176-supermomotaroudentetsu_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/5/b/gfs_7328_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/8/b/gfs_7328_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/c/6/gfs_7328_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/1/6/gfs_7328_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>	</game>	<game name="Super Momotarou Dentetsu II (Japan)">		<description>Super Momotarou Dentetsu II (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="E8B4891F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuper%20Momotarou%20Dentetsu%20II%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="4974D8E868CC359DCA73312749B71B0F163DF92E" size="187728" />		<title_clean>Super Momotarou Dentetsu II</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Momotarou Dentetsu II is the second "Super" game in the long-running Momotarou Dentetsu series and the third overall.

The player, along with either another human player or up to three AI opponents, race around a single-screen track in a format similar to Atari's Super Sprint. The player can upgrade their car's stats with the money earned after each race, or purchase more Nitro for one-off speed boosts.[CR]Different versions have different features. The SNES version has twice as many tracks as the original Arcade game (sixteen rather than eight), and the NES version allows up to four players to play with the NES Satellite or Four Score peripherals.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,4,5 adding, "...after a while it does get tough on the eyes and I found I could not play for very long. The truck controlled well and was faithful to the arcade game, but just too small.".[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>		<studio>Tradewest</studio>		<rating>7.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21773</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585935-super-off-road</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/super-off-road/3030-32988/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21773-1.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/7/d/gfs_38739_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/d/gfs_38739_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/0/gfs_38739_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/3/0/gfs_38739_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/0/gfs_38739_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/9/0/gfs_38739_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/2/0/gfs_38739_2_5.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/f/0/gfs_38739_2_6.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Super Pachinko Taisen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Super Pachinko Taisen (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="CDE0FF00" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuper%20Pachinko%20Taisen%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="642F4F6B043D8886D02552430BF3B3C87142AD2D" size="84626" />		<title_clean>Super Pachinko Taisen</title_clean>		<plot>Super Pachinko Taisen is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Kan's and published by Banpresto,which was released in Japan in 1995.</plot>		<releasedate>30/6/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Miscellaneous, Card</genre>		<studio>Kan's</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569933-super-pachinko-taisen</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/8/306388_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/8/8/306388_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/9/4/gfs_9380_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/4/4/gfs_9380_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/f/4/gfs_9380_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/e/4/gfs_9380_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/5/4/gfs_9380_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/8/4/gfs_9380_1_6.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/3/4/gfs_9380_1_7.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/5/gfs_9380_1_8.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/5/5/gfs_9380_1_9.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/1/5/gfs_9380_1_10.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Super R.C.

As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.[CR]The basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.[CR]All robots are licensed from two parties only  Sunrise and Dynamic  and when starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.[CR]Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of spiritual commands to be executed. These usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.[CR]Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back  this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.</plot>		<releasedate>20/4/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>RPG, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Banpresto Co.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<rating>3.1</rating>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/581765-super-robot-taisen</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/super-robot-taisen</mobygames_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10463</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/3/4/311334_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/3/4/311334_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292131-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292133-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-choose-a-team.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292134-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-upgrading-the-team.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292136-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-starting-out-in-one.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292137-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-the-main-command-menu.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292138-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-certain-units-can-be.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292139-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-the-enemy-movement.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292140-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-the-white-squares-show.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292141-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-zz-gundam-attacked.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/292142-super-robot-taisen-game-boy-screenshot-shooting-back.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/T1AGjwU.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Super Scrabble (USA)">		<description>Super Scrabble (USA)</description>		<rom crc="3874B7A2" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuper%20Scrabble%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="59755C83DC26015C4084296AB06600FFC235F026" size="108944" />		<title_clean>Super Scrabble</title_clean>		<plot>With all that Super Scrabble has to offer, even the most traditional Scrabble player will smile with delight.

It features character designs based on Superman: The Animated Series.  In each level, you must collect a certain number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave.  Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies.[CR]Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them.  He can navigate environments through standard walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to fly.  He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health.  He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers.[CR]Some levels put ground under your feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight.  Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]While in game pause and enter code to access the level select screen.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Titus France SA</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21775</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/575150-superman</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/superman___</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/superman/3030-35747/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21775-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/5/3/7853_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204914-superman-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204915-superman-game-boy-screenshot-a-sniper-takes-aim-at-the-man.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204916-superman-game-boy-screenshot-superman-has-to-avoid-the-hovering.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204917-superman-game-boy-screenshot-about-to-take-off-for-a-flying.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204918-superman-game-boy-screenshot-this-is-what-the-game-says-if.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204920-superman-game-boy-screenshot-coming-in-under-the-bullets.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204922-superman-game-boy-screenshot-mid-air-collision.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204923-superman-game-boy-screenshot-slipping-between-two-guys-with.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204924-superman-game-boy-screenshot-superman-is-blinking-because.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204925-superman-game-boy-screenshot-level-3-warehouse.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Suzuki Aguri no F-1 Super Driving (Japan)">		<description>Suzuki Aguri no F-1 Super Driving (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="E82692D9" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSuzuki%20Aguri%20no%20F-1%20Super%20Driving%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="98D0E39251413F2F3BF2F001C48CCF88F27190BA" size="134501" />		<title_clean>Suzuki Aguri no F-1 Super Driving</title_clean>		<plot>Suzuki Aguri no F-1 Super Driving is a Driving game, developed by Pixel and published by LOZC G.

Rather than destroying his body the explosion, combined with the bio-restorative formula he was working on, mingled with the properties of the swamp waters transform Holland into the Swamp Thing.[CR]In this 2D side scrolling action-platformer Swamp Thing confronts Arkane and his henchmen toward the goal of saving the planet.[CR]There was a separate Genesis version planned, with a different developer, but this was cancelled.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 3,4,3,3 stating, "...This game doesn't belong on a Game Boy let alone the NES!

The previous game used a password system for saving progress, whereas players can save anywhere at any time in The Sword of Hope II by pressing the Start button.[CR]In The Sword of Hope II, which has a lot in common with the classic franchises Wizardry and Bard's Tale, you take on the role of Prince Theo of Riccar, a young man who embarks on a mission to find the truth behind a mystery threatening the kingdom. It has been five years since Theo sealed away the Dragon of Darkness in The Sword of Hope. Since then, the kingdom has flourished. Unfortunately, something terrible has happened at the ancient temple long protected by the Collin Clan, and Theo's father King Hennesy sends him to investigate.[CR]The key to solving the numerous puzzles and gimmicks is the use of commands like &#8220;look,&#8221; &#8220;open,&#8221; and &#8220;hit.&#8221; Many secrets can be discovered by examining different aspects of the screen.[CR]Combat is turn-based, with actions like "attack," "magic," and "flee."[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Theo, the Petit Prince[CR]Unlike in The Sword of Hope, Theo can have up to two other party members in his company during battles. As he progresses, he'll meet four addable characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Every character can equip a weapon, armor, and accessory item.[CR]Theo is the previous protagonist of The Sword of Hope, as well as the protagonist of The Sword of Hope II. He has strong offense and defense skills, a good selection of weapons and armor to equip, and is able to learn magic spells like Melt, Motion, and Dark.Mute is his name, not an adjective[CR]Mute comes from a clan of mages. He is a magical powerhouse, learning most of the spells. This boy wizard joins Theo's company after the prince investigates the ancient temple to find everyone but Mute massacred. At first, Mute suspects Theo is the one who murdered his entire family. However, the quick appearance of Mute's father in ghostly forms convinces him otherwise, and the two join forces to find the demon responsible.Nina, missing her father[CR]Nina joins Theo's company after being rescued from a sandworm attack. She is searching for her father and believes that by using an item called the Sand Drop, it will reveal the underground template where he disappeared to. So far, she has not had any luck finding him.Bogi the Forthcoming Fire Dragonslayer[CR]Bogi saves Theo's company from a one-sided fight with a creeper monster, dealing massive damage to it in one fell swoop. He's a fighter who calls himself an expert monster hunter, with the main goal in life to kill a Fire Dragon...just for the fun of it. Seeing that Theo is traveling the lands, he joins up with the company in hope of finding a dragon along the way.Layl, probably short for Layla[CR]Layl is a young woman with strong healing powers. Before joining Theo's company, she saves the prince and his companions from a deadly whirlpool with the help of her submarine. She and the monster hunter Bogi are somewhat connected to each other, which leads some to awkward adventuring.[CR]Prince Theo will also come across a great number of NPCs, from innkeepers to shopkeepers to fortune tellers. Some of the more colorful characters include the demon Jaghi, King Winder, and old man Yota, a hermit living in a sea-side cave.[CR]Magic[CR]As Theo and his company levels up, they will learn new spells. Nina and Bogi are unable to learn magic spells, leaving the majority of casting to Theo, Mute, and Layl.Spell nameLearned atEffectMotionLevel 2 for Theo, Level 14 for LaylUnknown[CR]Snooze[CR]Level 3 for Theo, Level 18 for Layl[CR]Puts a single monster to sleep[CR]Fire[CR]Level 2 for Mute[CR]Fire-based attack against a single monster[CR]Stone[CR]Level 3 for Mute[CR]Instant death spell that hardens a monster&#8217;s skinMeltLevel 4 for Theo, Level 15 for LaylUnknown[CR]Dark[CR]Level 5 for Theo, Level 19 for Layl[CR]Gives a monster blindness, making it impossible to attack[CR]Flame[CR]Level 4 for Mute[CR]Fire-based attack capable of targeting an entire group of monsters[CR]Medic[CR]Level 6 for Theo, Level 6 for Mute, Level 20 for Layl[CR]Heals a character for 10 to 20 HP[CR]Teleport[CR]Level 7 for Theo, Level 16 for Layl[CR]Able to transport Theo&#8217;s company to a specific location[CR]Blaze[CR]Level 7 for Mute[CR]Fire-based spell that engulfs every enemy in flames[CR]De-spell[CR]Level 8 for Theo, Level 8 for Mute, Level 21 for LaylUnknownFortifyLevel 9 for TheoUnknownBlindLevel 10 for Theo, Level 22 for LaylUnknownWeakenLevel 11 for TheoUnknownSlumberLevel 12 for Theo, Level 23 for LaylSleep spell capable of putting a group of enemies asleepSteal MPLevel 13 for Theo, Level 31 for LaylSteals a small amount of MP from an enemyAnti MagicLevel 14 for Theo, Level 14 for MuteUnknownHealLevel 15 for Theo, Level 15 for Mute, Level 25 for LaylUnknownBlackoutLevel 16 for Theo, Level 26 for LaylUnknownSteal HPLevel 17 for Theo, Level 30 for LaylUnknownExitLevel 18 for Theo, Level 17 for LaylUnknownRecoverLevel 19 for Theo, Level 27 for LaylUnknownPillageLevel 20 for Theo, Level 32 for LaylUnknownReviveLevel 24 for LaylUnknownCureLevel 28 for LaylUnknownMiracleLevel 29 for LaylUnknown[CR]Coins[CR]After you win a battle, there's a 75% chance you'll get a Coin. This is different than the standard gold received after a successful fight. The text will say, "The spoils of the battle go to Theo," and you can later use these Coins to play a game of chance in the Casino for various prizes or sell it to merchants for around 400 gold.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1996</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Kemco</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>1.8</rating>		<videoid>fXexFuCZM4k</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21776</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585940-sword-of-hope-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/sword-of-hope-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-sword-of-hope-ii/3030-8553/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10329</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21776-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207042-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207043-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152114-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152115-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152116-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-prince-theo-the-main.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152117-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-the-castle-of-ricca-where.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152118-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-exploring-the-area.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152119-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-battle-against-a-blob.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152120-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-reading-some-books-in.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152121-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-battle-against-a-ghost.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152122-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-discovering-a-hidden.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/152123-sword-of-hope-ii-game-boy-screenshot-in-front-of-zakdos-broken.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/r7cmVH8.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Sword of Hope, The (USA)">		<description>Sword of Hope, The (USA)</description>		<rom crc="7E923846" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FSword%20of%20Hope%2C%20The%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="5F30147162E2A38DBB90A233F22DF0A6AA3D99FB" size="89410" />		<title_clean>Sword of Hope, The</title_clean>		<plot>A dragon has gained control over the king of Riccar, manipulating him into removing the Sword of Hope from a painting, releasing its curse. Summoning the dark power mammon the dragon turned the people of Riccar into trees. When Prince Theo is born, the king tries to murder him, but Theo is saved by the brave knight Pascal who flees with him  into a forest where three magicians live who conceal the king's castle underground to prevent the evil from spreading. After living in the forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved.[CR]Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. The prince can select commands such as "look", "open", "magic", "use" etc. to interact with  the game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When he encounters an enemy, the game switches to a turn based battle mode in which enemies have to be fought in typical console style RPG battles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] End of Game code[CR]D4XM  HFXQ [CR]MLX/  VTM8 [CR]/ = Greek Symbol Lambda [CR]8 = Infinity symbol [CR]This is the revised version of the code I had up earlier, which was not working for some reason.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. [CR]Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.[CR]T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.[CR]Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>LJN</studio>		<nplayers>1-2

Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.[CR]Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen.

This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care.  Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.[CR]Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name.  In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room.  From there, you are fully responsible for its care.  Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.[CR]Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options.  You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously.  The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness.  The three games are:[CR] Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right.  Try to guess which direction it will face next.[CR] Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study.  Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.[CR] Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit.  Baseballs will rain down from the sky.  Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.[CR]Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments.  You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments.  You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could.  Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincible tamagotchi[CR]If you enter the status window, your pet cannot die. This means that a couple of cheats are available. 1) If your pet dies, restarting the game and quickly entering the window before it dies again means that, if you exit the window a bit later, your pet is healthy and ready to carry on as normal, or 2) You can have a tamagotchi live forever. You need a Game Boy adaptor for this to work. Go to the status window, and leave your game boy plugged into the wall for as long as you want.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Mimitchi[CR]Hatch a pet from a black egg, and feed it nothing but carrots. When it is 6, it will turn into Mimitchi.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Mode[CR]With an Adult Tamagotchi, win ANY tournament. You will get a symbol above your tamagotchi's picture on it's stats screen. Now, go to the options menu. There will be a mode called MUSIC MODE. Inside are: [CR]Sound Test [CR]Sound FX test [CR]Sound Test Speed [CR]A gallery of ALL the characters you get after that Tamagotchi wins. They are numbered and you have to get all of them to beat the entire game.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1997</releasedate>		<year>1997</year>		<studio>Bandai America</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<thegamesdb_id>21778</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/562640-tamagotchi</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/tamagotchi</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tamagotchi/3030-36275/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2405689-box_tgb.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/188104-tamagotchi-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441657-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441658-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-the-laboratory-provides-basic.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441659-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-tamagotchi-egg.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441660-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-give-your-pet-a-name.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441661-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-the-egg-has-hatched.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441662-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-my-pet-has-a-cold-but-doesn.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441663-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-let-s-give-him-some-food-to.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441664-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-my-tamagotchi-s-current-stats.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441665-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-oh-dear-he-s-wallowing-in-his.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/441666-tamagotchi-game-boy-screenshot-the-gb-version-features-three.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Tarzan (USA, Europe)">		<description>Tarzan (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="C2F50FB3" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTarzan%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="EAFF826C9256358D7920DE3956A8AB563D004D51" size="84101" />		<title_clean>Tarzan</title_clean>		<plot>We could call it a platform game if it wasn't 3D, but it still looks like a platform game.

Only two fictional teams can be chosen: the Wildcats and the Bulldogs. The 2D graphics were also more advanced than the NES version, with the arcade original having a larger color palette and more detailed sprites.[CR]NES Port[CR]The NES version features 12 NFL franchises from the year 1989. Although they didn&#8217;t have the official NFL license to use the actual team names and logos they were able to use the names of the players on those teams due to being licensed by the NFLPA (National Football League Players Association).[CR]Though the NES version was released in 1989, the player rosters are based on actual team rosters from the 1988 season. This is probably due to the game being developed and released prior to the start 1989 NFL season, which obviously made the 1989 rosters unavailable.NY vs. Miami (NES)[CR]The franchises are as follows:[CR]Indianapolis (Colts)[CR]Washington (Redskins)[CR]Miami (Dolphins)[CR]San Francisco (49ers)[CR]Cleveland (Browns)[CR]Dallas (Cowboys)[CR]Denver (Broncos)[CR]New York (Giants)[CR]Seattle (Seahawks)[CR]Chicago (Bears)[CR]Los Angeles (Raiders)[CR]Minnesota (Vikings)[CR]The rosters of the teams are pretty much complete except the offensive lineman are not named, and a couple of defensive positions are missing giving Tecmo Bowl football nine players on each side of the ball instead of the standard eleven. It should be noted however that later copies of the game had slightly different rosters. Example: Eric Dickerson, typically the starting running back for Indianapolis, was replaced by Albert Bentley. There are others differences but not many.Game Options[CR]1 Player Game &#8211; Consists of your chosen team going through the list of other teams at random. That&#8217;s if you continue to win. One loss and you are done. The difficulty of the game gets a little harder with each team you face, which means that the computer controlled players progressively move faster.[CR]2 Player Game &#8211; One game featuring the standard vs. mode. You against a friend[CR]Coach -- This mode is like the 2 Player Game. The major difference is that it still allows each player to pick the plays, but the computer controls the football players and how the play is carried out.Gameplay[CR]Each team has four offensive plays to choose from. Most teams have 2 running plays and 2 passing plays. The exceptions being Miami and San Fransisco, they have 3 passing plays. The team on offense and the team on defense pick from those four offensive plays. Of course the team with the ball picks the play they want to run. The defense picks the play that they think the offense is going to pick, and if they choose correctly it&#8217;s an almost certain loss of yards or an interception. Once the plays are picked it goes to the field to be carried out. It plays like any other standard football game but with a couple notable exceptions. One, the defensive player only gets to control one defender the whole play, no switching to a guy that is closer. Two, if the QB throws to a receiver that is covered by either a human-controlled or computer-controlled player then it almost always results an automatic interception, even if that player is a defensive lineman. Because of this, it's important to pick/control you fastest, most talented defensive player regardless of what position he plays and always cover a receiver. The fastest, most talented defensive players on each team are easy to identify because they have the best (highest) stats. Most teams have one really good defensive player, several have more than one and a couple don't have anyone who is all that good. Sacks are not recognized in Tecmo Bowl and there aren't any fumbles, so interceptions are the only turnovers.[CR]Also, one last tidbit of information. The defensive players, and only the defensive players, have the ability to dive. Usually when you want to tackle someone the defender runs right up to the ball carrier and tries to wrestle him down. For a second or two both players tap the A button to try to either break the tackle or in the case of the defender, bring the runner down. The only draw back to this tactic is that sometimes an Offensive Lineman will come along to help the runner and instantly throw the defender, basically rendering the defender useless for the rest of the play. Using a dive tackle, if it successfully connects, instantly brings the ball carrier down. But if the dive misses then it will take a while for that player to not only get back to his feet, but also get back up to top speed. And by then the runner is long gone. As a rule of thumb, only use the a dive when you know an OL is coming for you.Field Goal/Punt Kicking[CR]Since this game is in essence a 2D side-scoller, when kicking field goals or punts, you only have to worry about power. When the meter fills to your desired level just hit the button. Simple as that.[CR]When the game was released for the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 8,8,6,4 saying, "...a fantastic translation of football from the programmers of one of the best sports simulations ever".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Game Passwords[CR]To play the final game Los Angeles vs. Miami, enter this password: [B]94BFFDAI[/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Game Passwords[CR]To play against the same team that you want to play as, enter one of the following passwords:</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action, Sports</genre>		<studio>Tecmo</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>		<rating>3.1</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21783</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585947-tecmo-bowl</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/tecmo-bowl</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tecmo-bowl/3030-11229/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/139866/2696307-9840273512-41002.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218611-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298618-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-tecmo-bowl-is-an-official-nfl.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298597-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-with-options.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298598-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-make-your-selection-of-a-team.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298600-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-the-game-is-about-to-begin.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298602-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-move-in-the-playbook.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298604-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-touchdown-this-defense-sucks.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298606-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-who-is-ricky-sanders-oh-well.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298609-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-half-time-intermission.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298610-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-the-band-is-marching-in.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/298614-tecmo-bowl-game-boy-screenshot-poor-seattle-better-luck-next.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Fall of the Foot Clan (Europe)">		<description>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Fall of the Foot Clan (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="ED8A73FB" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTeenage%20Mutant%20Hero%20Turtles%20-%20Fall%20of%20the%20Foot%20Clan%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="CF1D432B93E6A606D95BF7397A088B79CD69E108" size="84025" />		<title_clean>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - Fall of the Foot Clan</title_clean>		<plot>In cahoots with exiled alien zap master Krang, the evil Shredder has once again kidnapped the dashing damsel of the news desk, April O'Neil.

In between levels, you are treated to bonus games that allow you to increase your health meter or rescue captured turtles.[CR]The music in the game is a surprisingly accurate rendition of the music found in the cartoon series.

Shredder has escaped from prison, and managed to capture turtle-friendly reporter April O'Neal yet again! Only this time, he manages to capture three of the turtles, Raphael, Donatello, and Leonardo, before the game even starts. So, you start out as Michaelangelo on a quest to rescue your pals and restore justice to the city.[CR]Radical Rescue differs from the previous Ninja Turtle games greatly in terms of level structure.  The linear levels have been replaced with one huge interconnected fortress.  You progress through the game by finding the various bosses hidden within the fortress, defeating them, and then using the keys they leave behind to open up new rooms.  When you happen to find one of the turtles that has been captured, they become a playable character.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Last stage with full HP[CR]In Europe version, put 1HHHHH2 as the password.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Konami (America)</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>g9Uz11gDPTM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>6125</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585953-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue/3030-17952/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8618</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6125-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6125-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56864-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213576-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21245-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21246-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21247-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21248-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21249-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/21250-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-radical-rescue-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/3/6/gfs_2339_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/4/gfs_38753_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/5/0/gfs_97178_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/8/0/gfs_97178_1_2.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/oLu1TO3.jpg</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Teke Teke!

The Game Boy version is unlike the console and computer versions of the game. The game takes place in two time periods: 2029, when the Terminators have taken over the world, and 1994, when John Connor is ten years old and his future self has reprogrammed a Terminator to protect him from a more advanced model.[CR]In the early levels of the game, you play as the future John Connor - your objectives are to destroy generators to gain access to Skynet. Once inside, you must make your way through Skynet and obtain a Terminator yourself. These levels are played in a side-scrolling fashion. The next level is a difficult puzzle - you must reprogram the Terminator so that it will protect John Connor instead of killing him.

Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Strategy</genre>		<studio>GameTek</studio>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>21784</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585959-tesserae</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/tesserae</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tesserae/3030-3648/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21784-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/5/7/46857_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443934-tesserae-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443935-tesserae-game-boy-screenshot-choose-your-level-and-grid.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443936-tesserae-game-boy-screenshot-my-first-grid.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443937-tesserae-game-boy-screenshot-i-selected-a-tile-and-these-are.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/443938-tesserae-game-boy-screenshot-i-ve-cleared-a-row.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/7/9/gfs_38758_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/a/9/gfs_38758_1_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/e/4/gfs_38758_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/3/4/gfs_38758_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/8/4/gfs_38758_2_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Tetris (World) (Rev A)">		<description>Tetris (World) (Rev A)</description>		<rom crc="46DF91AD" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTetris%20%28World%29%20%28Rev%20A%29.zip" sha1="74591CC9501AF93873F9A5D3EB12DA12C0723BBC" size="19566" />		<title_clean>Tetris</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the 1986 MS-DOS version of Tetris.[CR]Tetris was originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, who designed and programmed the game in June 1985 while working in the USSR at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science in Moscow. The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra", which means "four", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris Giant[CR]Tetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.[CR]Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play with faster game level speeds[CR]When you get to the main screen, press the [B]DOWN ARROW[/B] key while pressing the [B]START[/B] key to begin the game. You will play with levels faster by 10 levels, which means that Level 1 = Level 11, Level 2 = Level 12, and so on.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See rocket blast off[CR]You mush finish Game A with 100,000 points or more and you will see an animation af a rocket blasting off.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See rocket blast off[CR]If you want to see a bunch of Russian guys dancing in Tetris, then you must beat level 9 of Game Type B[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Disable the Next box[CR]To do this, press select during a game.

You will get it more often every time that you do so.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>		<rating>3.6</rating>		<videoid>F0D66kgyEMI</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>18603</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585961-tetris-2</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/tetris-2</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-2/3030-12562/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13074</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362304-nes_tetris2_2.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172279-tetris-2-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/170593-tetris-2-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103764-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-with-the-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/157335-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-jpn.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103758-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-make-your-favorite-game-adjust.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103759-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-clear-the-flash-blocks-is-the.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103763-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-you-lost-if-you-exceed-the-screen.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103757-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-these-are-the-3-opponents-available.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103761-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-playing-against-the-computer.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103762-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-sorry-the-computer-wins-the-first.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/103760-tetris-2-game-boy-screenshot-use-the-biggest-possible-number.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/6/2/gfs_38760_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/0eFDLxX.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Tetris Attack (USA) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Tetris Attack (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="B76C769B" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTetris%20Attack%20%28USA%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="3DE8D7F30322BC50008AB0D917ACD0A934B5B195" size="190739" />		<title_clean>Tetris Attack</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tetris Attack is the North American version of Panel de PonTetris Attack is the North American version of Panel de Pon (Paneru de Pon), initially a Japanese game which was one of the founders of the now commonly found "tile swapping" mechanic of puzzle gameplay. The core gameplay consists of a well partially filled with either 5 or 6 distinct types of tiles, depending on the difficulty level. Adjacent tiles may be swapped horizontally with the cursor, and matching three or more tiles vertically or horizontally will result in the tiles clearing after a short delay animation, during which they become immovable. Additional points may be earned with either "combos," which involve clearing more than 3 tiles simultaneously, or "chains," which require that the tiles above a clearing set fall into another clear. During play, the stack of tiles will slowly rise to the top of the screen, though clearing tiles will pause this advance. After a grace period after the stack reaches the top of the well, the game will end.The version of Panel de Pon included in the Japan-only Nintendo Puzzle Collection has more differences from the original game than any other game included on the disc. The game is essentially the same as Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League, as it is a version of the game skinned as "Panel de Pon 64." Thus, it features many of the same things as Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League (such as a 3D mode, new characters, updated graphics, and a new four-player mode, which wasn't in Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League). Despite these changes, gameplay-wise it is nothing more than an enhanced version of Panel de Pon.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]There are 5 major game modes in Tetris Attack. In most modes, a difficulty level may be selected, and in some modes an initial speed may be selected; this may be confusing to new players, but while the difficulty level affects the rate at which death occurs, the number of tile types in play, and the rate at which tiles fall upon finding themselves in mid-air, the initial speed merely controls the speed at which the stack rises.EndlessThis mode allows the player to select a difficulty level and speed, and allows nearly limitless play. The name of the mode is misleading, however, as gameplay will necessarily end: either the player will die, or reach 99,999 points, upon which the game will end. Should the player reach this maximum point score, credits will be rolled.Time TrialThis mode provides a 2 minute length of time in which to earn as many points as possible. The difficulty and speed may be set prior to the game. This mode may be played with either 1 or 2 players.Stage ClearThe Stage Clear mode requires that players clear the stack down to a particular "clear line" to pass each stage, of which there are several per character in the game. In addition, there are certain "boss battles," in which the player must earn points as quickly as possible to reduce the boss's HP level to zero.PuzzleThis mode involves a collection of designed puzzles, of which there are ten per character in the game, as well as many "special" levels, totaling 120 levels. Each involves a set of tiles that must be cleared completely within the predetermined number of tile swaps.VSA screenshot of gameplayThe VS mode is the only game mode to feature the Garbage mechanic, as well as the only mode which features a computer-controlled AI. In it, each player attempts to stay alive and force the other player to lose first. This may be done by dumping "garbage blocks" upon the other player, by creating either combos or chains. Increasingly large combos will result in larger-width as well as multiple single slabs of garbage to be dropped on the player's opponent, while increasingly large chains will result in thicker single blocks of garbage. Clearing garbage may be done by matching three or more tiles adjacent to the garbage, upon which all the garbage in contact in the stack will flash and begin transforming into normal tiles, starting from the very bottom and progressing to the top of the garbage stack. These tiles, though revealed, are not in play until the entire stack has transformed, upon which it will fall onto the existing stack; this lag time is in turn an excellent time to anticipate and create large combos and chains. However, garbage created with chains consists of single multilayer blocks; these blocks will not completely transform with each attempt - instead, only the bottom layer will become normal tiles, while the rest will transform back into a single block.In addition, there are special tiles in the VS mode which are gray and marked with exclamation points. These appear only sporadically, and, when matched, create special "steel" garbage blocks to be dropped on the player's opponent. These are unique because they do not clear when in contact with regular clearing garbage - they must be cleared separately. This effectively limits the clearing ability of one's opponent, and is particularly useful when sandwiched between two large segments of regular garbage.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]YoshiBumptyFlutterGargantua BlarggLunge FishPrince FroggyLakituPoochyHookbill the KoopaNaval PiranhaKamekBowser[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]As mentioned above, tiles may be cleared in either "combos" or "chains" for additional points.CombosCombos are achieved by clearing more than three tiles simultaneously. This can be done either through clever tile manipulation, or by matching tiles to inactive rows as they appear on screen. A more advanced method, called "garbage chaining," involves matching tiles in play with clearing rows of garbage from above. This is particularly useful for dealing with single blocks of thick garbage.The scoring details of combos are as follows:4 tiles: 20 points5 tiles: 30 points6 tiles: 50 points7 tiles: 60 points8 tiles: 70 points9 tiles: 80 points10 tiles: 100 points11 tiles: 140 points12 tiles: 170 pointsChainsChains are much more difficult to plan and execute than combos, and are thus worth substantially more points. Tiles must fall from above a clear into another clear to create a chain; once this condition is failed, the chain ends and a new one must be initiated. There are several advanced techniques involving chains, many of which are detailed in Advanced Gameplay Mechanics below. Noteworthy, however, is the fact that Tetris Attack does not in fact recognize chains of longer than 13 - rather than the standard x14 or x15 icon which would be the expected result of further chaining, players are presented with a x? icon and rewarded no points whatsoever for their continued efforts.Another nuance in the scoring system involving chains, however, is that of "bonuses." When a normal clear is made alongside a chain, that clear is awarded the same number of points as the current chain clear, instead of the standard clear amount. Thus, a standard strategy when trying to score points quickly is to quickly build out to a x13 chain, then instantly initiating as many standard three tile clears on the side as possible to maximize the number of points earned on the chain.The scoring details of chains are as follows:x2 chain: 50 pointsx3 chain: 80 pointsx4 chain: 150 pointsx5 chain: 300 pointsx6 chain: 400 pointsx7 chain: 500 pointsx8 chain: 700 pointsx9 chain: 900 pointsx10 chain: 1100 pointsx11 chain: 1300 pointsx12 chain: 1500 pointsx13 chain: 1800 pointsx14 chain: 0 points[CR]Advanced Gameplay Mechanics[CR]Several nuances in Tetris Attack's engine allow for unique techniques while playing Tetris Attack. Since most rules are calculated on a frame-by-frame basis, some of the basic physical rules of the game can be bent - others may be broken. For instance, it is possible for a single tile to very briefly, while in the process of shifting between two columns, support two sets of falling tiles above it, just long enough to register the above tiles as a clear should they be positioned as such. This is particularly useful as a last-resort when attempted to keep chains alive. It is also possible, though vastly more difficult, to swap tiles in midair as they fall, and to swap tiles "through" clear arrangements such as they do not trigger the clear.[CR]Story and Multiple Endings[CR]Choosing one of the friends to free.Tetris Attack's story is rather loose: there appears to be some sort of curse which has befallen all the major characters (who were enemies from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, but are apparently now friends) except for Yoshi, and Yoshi must therefore battle each character in a VS mode match to free them. Upon freeing Lakitu, Bumpty, Poochy, Flying Wiggler, Froggy, Blargg, Lunge Fish, and Rafael the Raven, the gang continues on to defeat Hookbill the Koopa, Naval Piranha, Kamek, and finally Bowser (in difficulty levels above easy) in the Cave of Darkness to win the day. Upon completion on hard, a code is given to the player to unlock "hardest" mode, and upon completion of hardest mode without dying, another code is given which allows the selection of characters prior to each match rather than only matches in the Cave of Darkness; the point is to choose characters other than Yoshi, as hinted at in the dialogue. Each level of completion involves a different set of dialogue at the end. However, this final step to achieving the VS mode "perfect" ending is rather superfluous, as it is no more difficult than beating the game on hardest without dying without the character selection.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Super Hard Game Mode[CR]Step 1) Goto Vs.

Tetris Blast features both a single player mode and a two player mode. Tetris Blast differs in some ways from the original     Tetris. In Tetris Blast there are pieces of the blocks that contain bombs, when the bombs are part of a row that has been completed they will explode. If four bombs are touching and make up a square they will turn into a large bomb which will explode much larger than the regular size bombs.  [CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]In Tetris Blast there are three different playable single player modes:  Contest  In contest mode there is a different arrangement of  already placed blocks and the goal is to try and remove all blocks from  the field. Contest mode features a password save system.   Contest ModeTraining  Training mode is an infinite mode where the player can select the speed of the falling blocks.  Training Mode Fight   In fight mode a computer opponent is chosen. The computer opponent will  travel back and forth across the play field and the goal is to hit the  enemy with enough of the bomb blocks to reduce their health to zero.

The player takes control of all three children as they go through training and are then forced to travel around the world to save members of International Rescue from an evil villain known as The Hood.[CR]The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the three characters has his or her own unique abilities that the player must use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles from an overhead view, there are also flight action sequences where the player can fly one of the many vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/thunderbirds[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/2004</releasedate>		<year>2004</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>VU Games</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569827-gerry-andersons-thunderbirds</gamefaqs_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5467</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/2/2/306322_front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/7/8/gfs_7495_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/a/8/gfs_7495_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/1/8/gfs_7495_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/e/5/gfs_7495_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/3/5/gfs_7495_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>	</game>	<game name="Tintin - Prisoners of the Sun (Europe) (En,Fr,De)">		<description>Tintin - Prisoners of the Sun (Europe) (En,Fr,De)</description>		<rom crc="55FC585F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTintin%20-%20Prisoners%20of%20the%20Sun%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%29.zip" sha1="A26A769AAC6060705F24C3E0DDE367B62962E921" size="189208" />		<title_clean>Tintin - Prisoners of the Sun</title_clean>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5469</consolegrid_url>	</game>	<game name="Tintin in Tibet (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Nl) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Tintin in Tibet (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Nl) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="5D2BD778" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTintin%20in%20Tibet%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CNl%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="8D8978FBD5A5634E2CCE940122039D575E7B3646" size="199178" />		<title_clean>Tintin in Tibet</title_clean>		<plot>Tintin au Tibet was first released on SNES and Genesis  before making its way to the Game Boy Color.  It was developed and published by Atari and follows the plot of the comic.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet tells the same story as the Tintin au Tibet comic written by Herge.  It follows the adventures of young, Belgian reporter Tintin and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Tournesol.  While Tintin and his friends are vacationing in a Swiss mountain resort, they get news about a plane crash in Tibet. Tintin starts having dreams of his friend Tchang, stranded in the Himalayas, calling for help. The next day, he receives a letter from Tchang confirming the fact that he was indeed on the doomed flight  and Tintin decides to go to the crash site to see once and for all if his friend is really dead.  Tintin and Haddock go to Kathmandu and meet with Tharkey, a sherpa, who initially refuses to bring them to the crash site. After Haddock changes his mind, Tharkey, Tintin, Haddock, and a support team decide to climb to where the plane crashed.  Their adventure doesn't go as smoothly as they thought it would.  First, Tintin's dog Milou almost drowns and then the support team abandons them because they're afraid of the Yeti.  They finally make it to where the plane crashed.  They find proof that Tchang survived the accident, but  he is nowhere to be found.  Tintin is about to give up when he finds his friend's scarf and decides to follow this new trail.  After narrowly avoiding a lethal avalanche, they find a Buddhist monastery. One of the monks has a supernatural power and is able to locate Tchang, who's been in the Yeti's cave and was taken care of by the Yeti. Tintin reunites with his friend and leaves the cave.  The game's cut scenes were actually parts of the animated series Tintin au Tibet that was released at about the same time as the game.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet is a platformer.  The player controls Tintin and must jump around multiple levels that range from a train station all the way to top of the Himalaya. Tintin can get hurt by a lot of things in the game's universe: butlers, bells, cows and even random people.  The gameplay tries to recreate some of the famous scenes from the comic.  In the scene where Milou almost drowns, the player must swim to go get him.  The game has the player climbing and sometimes sliding around the different levels.

(US release) for the Game Boy platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Torpedo Range the player is tasked with freeing six countries ports that have been taken over by terrorists. To free the ports in each country the player must first explore the waters around the port, taking out enemy ships and earning shield upgrades and more torpedoes. [CR]There are four different types of ship encounters and the main port takeover encounter to complete in each stage.CarriersFiring missiles at a jet.[CR]One of the ship encounters that will be engaged in is the enemy carriers. The carrier is in the background while the player takes control of a submarine under the water. Jets will then fly overhead with the player trying to shoot missiles straight up from the water and hit them. Once all the jets have been taken care of a ship will come by and drop bombs at the player.Cruisers[CR]In the cruiser encounters players are given control of the surfaced submarine from an almost third person "over-the-shoulder" view. Enemy cruisers will go by back and forth in the background at varying distances while the player is tasked with shooting missiles at them while dodging their incoming attacks.Submarines[CR]When the enemy submarines are approached the view is similar to that of the carrier encounters. Players take control of the submersed submarine on a single screen and tries to attack and destroy the enemy submarines which are moving through the water.BattleshipsFighting a battleship.[CR]In the battleship stages players are once again taking control of the surfaced submarine. This time the view is much like the view in the carrier encounters, but this time is from the side of the sub rather than the front. Players can move left to right shooting at the battleships guns as they try and shoot back. There is also a ship which will drop explosives onto the water, setting it on fire for a short time.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Shooter</genre>		<studio>Romstar</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<videoid>r7tkwCC2RsU</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>24131</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569686-torpedo-range</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/torpedo-range</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/torpedo-range/3030-38652/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/24131-1.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/2/0/306220_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736365-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736366-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-select-nation.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736367-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736368-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-world-map.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736369-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-game-starts.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736370-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-shooter-mode.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736371-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-destroy-ship.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736372-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-small-fail.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736373-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-find-a-mission.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/736374-torpedo-range-game-boy-screenshot-victory.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Total Carnage (USA, Europe)">		<description>Total Carnage (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="3700927F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTotal%20Carnage%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="A735C8D212C5FCB47A1D25599EDB1FB815593DD1" size="73082" />		<title_clean>Total Carnage</title_clean>		<plot>Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem lead your force... all right, actually they are your face.

Your character has a vacuum cleaner attached to his backpack, and you must use it to suck up enemies into the backpack and shoot them back out before they break out. Enemies will often give out letters that spell out the word TUMBLEPOP. If the player collects all the letters, the current level is bypassed and a bonus game will be played where money, extra lives, and other items can be collected. After several levels, a boss needs to be defeated, and these bosses include a squid, man-eating plant, a genie, a fire creature, snow man, clown throwing bombs, robot, and a giant alien creature. A construction mode is available, so that you can create your own levels.</plot>		<releasedate>20/11/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Data East Corporation</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<videoid>9PvO1HnJ8qo</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21797</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585976-tumble-pop</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/tumble-pop</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tumble-pop/3030-11637/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/16944/1831334-tumblepop_arcadeflyer.png</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194052-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194053-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-password-input.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194054-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-world-map.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194055-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-level-map.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194056-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-game-play.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194057-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-zoned-out.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194058-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-sucking-an-enemy-up-into-the.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194059-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-enemy-gets-dazed.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194060-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-stage-complete.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/194061-tumble-pop-game-boy-screenshot-items-that-you-are-carrying.jpg</snapshot10>		<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/21797.png</clearlogo1>	</game>	<game name="Turn and Burn (USA)">		<description>Turn and Burn (USA)</description>		<rom crc="91394BD8" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FTurn%20and%20Burn%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="28BF175C8B3990F97039062C22D80BC7A524F060" size="59492" />		<title_clean>Turn and Burn</title_clean>		<plot>Turn and Burn: The F-14 Dogfight Simulator is a Simulation game, developed by Imagineering Inc and published by Absolute Entertainment,which was released in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>14/5/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Simulation, Flight Simulator</genre>		<studio>Imagineering Inc</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<rating>1.0</rating>		<videoid>6lZumDOVQfg</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21798</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585977-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator/3030-16753/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21798-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/0/8/46908_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286379-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286380-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286381-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286382-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286384-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286383-turn-and-burn-the-f-14-dogfight-simulator-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/d/a/gfs_38772_1_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/0/a/gfs_38772_1_2.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/b/a/gfs_38772_1_3.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/a/a/gfs_38772_1_4.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Turok -

The player, as the bio-mechanical mutant warrior The Turrican, must make their way across a semi-non-linear world and defeat a boss before they can move onto the next world. The Turrican can change its weapon type, but any weapon besides the default will require finite ammo which must be found in the environment first.[CR]Turrican was originally developed for the Commodore 64 by a single programmer/designer, Manfred Trenz, but the Amiga and Genesis conversions are the best known versions. This is due in part to the music composed by Chris Huelsbeck for those versions. Turrican also saw releases for the Game Boy and TurboGrafx-16. Super Turrican (NES) is a composite game partly based on stages in the original Turrican and its sequel Turrican 2. Numerous homebrew attempts have been made to reboot Turrican for the modern era.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story (like found in the home computer manuals) is fast told: A long time ago the three-headed creature called Morgul was banished by the hero Devolon to an unknown dimension. The reason for this feat was that Morgul tormented the mankind with fears and nightmares. After Morgul's banishment fear and sleepless nights disappeared out of peoples lives. But since lately the people suffer again from a serious state of dread and fear and the nightmares come back. The apprehension is great that Morgul has returned to his kingdom. So armed with the latest weapons and technical equipment the player has to find and destroy Morgul in his kingdom.[CR]An alternate story is given in the Genesis/TurboGrafx-16 versions: Here is Morgul (Multiple-Organism-Unit-Link) a powerfull ecosystem generation network which the early colonists used to render the world of Alterra inhabitable. After a cataclysmic quake all system interface functions were severed and Morgul rebelled. He twisted all lifeforms of Alterra to his brutal, destructive purposes. To recapture Alterra genetic scientists created Turrican, a bio-engineered mutant warrior. Turricans task is to eliminate hostile organisms from Alterras five colonies and to destroy the three faces of Morgul.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility and Stage Skip[CR]While at the title screen press [B] A, B, B, A, B, A, A, B, A, A, B, A, A [/B].

It features a sword-wielding mech fighting to emancipate the Earth from the bug-like alien race known as Radam, who use the Tekkamen (transformed human captives) as their footsoldiers.[CR]The game is a traditional side-scrolling shoot 'em up for the most part, with the player controlling Tekkaman Blade as he cuts a swath through the alien forces. When encountering a boss in the SNES version, often a humanoid enemy Tekkaman of relative size to Tekkaman Blade, the game switches to a basic one-on-one fighting game with larger character sprites.[CR]Tekkaman Blade was first released on Game Boy by Sun L and Yutaka in December 1992 and then on the Super Famicom by A.I. and BEC in July 1993. A PC-9801 version, which plays far more like a strategy game, was released in 1994.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>18/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Sun L</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569733-tekkaman-blade</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/uch-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade_</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/uchuu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade/3030-26891/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/2627644-space+knight+tekkaman+blade+cover+front.jpg</boxart1>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/708037-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/708038-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-story.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/704547-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/704549-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-the-game.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/704550-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-using-the.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/704551-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-boss-fight.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/704552-uchu-no-kishi-tekkaman-blade-game-boy-screenshot-continue.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/0/7/gfs_7820_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/d/7/gfs_7820_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/6/7/gfs_7820_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Uchuu Senkan Yamato (Japan)">		<description>Uchuu Senkan Yamato (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="5BF747F8" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FUchuu%20Senkan%20Yamato%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="574CFB77817D3466672A9B39E6E8D467295FFD66" size="118296" />		<title_clean>Uchuu Senkan Yamato</title_clean>		<plot>Uchuu Senkan Yamato is a Strategy game, published by Bec,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>17/7/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Strategy, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Bec</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569734-uchuu-senkan-yamato</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/uch-senkan-yamato_</mobygames_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/0/7/296607_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/0/7/296607_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688559-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688558-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688560-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-the-battlefield.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688561-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-moving-your-ships.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688562-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-details-about-the-enemy.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688563-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-a-battle-about-to-commence.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688564-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-blasting-away.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688565-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-result-is-even.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688567-uchu-senkan-yamato-game-boy-screenshot-chance-to-blast-some.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/d/c/gfs_7918_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ultima - Runes of Virtue (USA)">		<description>Ultima - Runes of Virtue (USA)</description>		<rom crc="C44A0F1E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FUltima%20-%20Runes%20of%20Virtue%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="8D911CBBC6BD1518A85282DEF7F01D3ADD16E596" size="92263" />		<title_clean>Ultima - Runes of Virtue</title_clean>		<plot>Runes Of Virtue is an action-RPG specifically made for the Game Boy.

The UK release was titled Konami Golf while the Japanese release was titled Konamic Golf.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An overhead view of the first hole.[CR]Players start each hole in Ultra Golf by getting an overhead view of the course. To the right side of the map some information will be given to the player such as:Hole number.Wind direction and speed.The location of the ball (I.E. fairway, rough, green, ect.)Which player is currently up.How many shots over/under par the current player is.[CR]This information will also be displayed during play while the player is zoomed in on the course. Hitting the BallGetting ready to hit the ball.[CR]Once the player has chosen the direction the ball will be hit in it is time to make the shot. On the shot screen the player can more fine tune which direction the shot will be made. Once the direction has been set the next thing is to select the club. Once the club has been selected the stance of the player is chosen which will allow for hook shots. [CR]The final stage of hitting the ball is a "two click" system in which the player starts a cursor which will go around a circle. The button is then pressed when that cursor hits the desired power level. The cursor will then swing back. The button must be pressed again to indicate the desired angle of the swing. Game Modes[CR]There are only two modes of play in Ultra Golf, tournament and practice. Tournament mode starts off with the player getting to select how many days the tournament lasts. The tournament is between the player and 4 other computer controlled players. The player with the best score at the end is declared the winner.[CR]The practice mode allows the player to choose which of the two courses in the game to play. This allows the player to simply play that course and not compete against any computer controlled opponents.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Champ Course[CR]Win on the "Master" Course once to get this course.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Ultra</studio>		<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>		<rating>4.0</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21800</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585981-ultra-golf</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/ultra-golf</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ultra-golf/3030-34382/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21800-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/283288-ultra-golf-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/283003-ultra-golf-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688535-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-us-version-1992.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688536-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-japanese-version.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688537-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-european-version.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688538-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-name-entry.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688539-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-mode-select-1p-only.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688540-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-mode-select-1p-vs-2p.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688541-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-1st-day-let-s-have-some-fun.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688543-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-the-ball-is-already-flying.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688544-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-can-you-see-the-ball-good.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/688546-ultra-golf-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-green-peace-out.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Ultraman (Japan)">		<description>Ultraman (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="5944C3ED" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FUltraman%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="A4FBE124B257109BA9566FAE59AC008F52317F2D" size="74836" />		<title_clean>Ultraman</title_clean>		<plot>Ultraman is an Action game, published by Bec, which was released in Japan in 1991.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/home/569861.html[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] To unlock options menu[CR]At the title screen</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1991</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Bec</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569861-ultraman</gamefaqs_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ultraman/3030-40740/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2381331-ultramanarc.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/4/4/306344_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/9/f/gfs_7919_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/0/2/gfs_7919_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/d/2/gfs_7919_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/6/2/gfs_7919_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/7/2/gfs_7919_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/c/2/gfs_7919_2_5.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/1/2/gfs_7919_2_6.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/b/6/gfs_7919_3_1.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Ultraman Ball (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>Ultraman Ball (Japan) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="468D1A2E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FUltraman%20Ball%20%28Japan%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="3CDFCFB1A88D0CBFEB1C7B12751409FAF69BBA02" size="65186" />		<title_clean>Ultraman Ball</title_clean>		<plot>You're Ultraman. Well not really, but bear with me for a sec. Now as Ultraman, you have the ability to turn into an indestructible ball, uh, thing, and bounce around and stuff. This is essentially what Ultraman Ball is all about. Sadly, this is not some crazy kind of mascot volleyball game, sorry kids. Go play Sanrio Cup instead.[CR]Yep, being an indestructible bouncy ball is pretty damn nice. But being a regular Ultraman is pretty cool too. I mean, how else are you going to climb ladders? And you can use your hands to slowly slide down ledges, which you can use to your advantage to jump higher, Mega Man X-style. The key to Ultraman Ball, you see, is in your use of both forms. Why you're indestructible when you're all curled up in a ball and not when you're walking around like a normal human being, I don't know. You'd have to ask Ultraman.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Everything's complete except for the SGB border and the ending credits. Both are entirely possible to translate, but InVerse just doesn't want to. Cool.[CR]But yeah, other than that the whole game is completely translated, and very fun to play.

If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile. Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.[CR]Battles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to determine the amount of "effort" put into the attack or defense as well as a position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in battle, the player gains XP and gold.</plot>		<releasedate>10/12/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>RPG</genre>		<studio>Irem Corp.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569814-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa/3030-5540/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2254036-cover.png</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/1/0/306310_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444046-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444047-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444048-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444049-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444050-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444051-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444052-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444053-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444054-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/444055-undercover-cops-gaiden-hakaishin-garumaa-game-boy-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Universal Soldier (USA, Europe)">		<description>Universal Soldier (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="99AE9D06" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FUniversal%20Soldier%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="DBAF863D66A1E4C0A4F022BB2B228F0547674CDE" size="123268" />		<title_clean>Universal Soldier</title_clean>		<plot>Universal Soldier is the licensed video game based on the 1992 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop H.R. Malone, a politician and wealthy leader who plans on ascending to total domination using a superweapon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Urban Strike follows the Strike series' tried and true isometric game play and mission structure which is virtually untouched from the previous two games. Game mechanics also remain the same as the copilot system and rearming process all continue. New to the series are three on foot missions where players take control of the pilot and must go inside a structure armed with a machine gun and rocket launcher in order to rescue an important person or destroy the complex.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Following the defeat of Ibn Kilbaba and the supposed death of the Drug Lord, it would seem as the world is safe again from terrorism. But the rise of a new politician, H.R. Malone, gains the attention of the world and of STRIKE. Despite an undercover agent placed within Malone's organization, STRIKE does not know the plans Malone has for world domination. The informant is killed and again STRIKE calls in their top pilot to uncover the plot around this mysterious figure. Intelligence gathered from Hawaii reveals that Malone is actually Carlos Ortega, the Drug Lord, who had undergone plastic surgery to cover up his disfigured face and used his connections to reassert himself on the world stage. STRIKE again targets Malone's strategic investments that include oil rigs, auto factories and even Alcatraz Island. The search for Malone ends in Las Vegas as he makes his last stand inside the holding cell for superweapon, a giant laser. Malone is picked up with a bomb vest on and dropped directly into the superweapon, ridding the world of another despot and another threat averted thanks to the efforts of STRIKE.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Baja Oil Rigs-LK24JQNLS9J [CR]Mexico-D94R4XNHKCM [CR]Vegas-3780B4QC527 [CR]Malone's Base-K9L97VZGGSK [CR]Credits-D9MMMXGWHML</plot>		<releasedate>14/11/1996</releasedate>		<year>1996</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Black Pearl Software</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Isometric</perspective>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>21585</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585983-urban-strike</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/urban-strike</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/urban-strike/3030-9336/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21585-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/2/1/46921_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23105-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23106-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-mission-setup.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23107-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-briefing.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23108-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-campaign-1-map.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23109-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-destroy-this-visitor-center.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23110-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-rescue-a-co-pilot.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23111-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-oil-rig-heli-pad.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23112-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-rescue-chopper.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23113-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-foot-mission.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/23114-urban-strike-game-boy-screenshot-mexican-village-super-game.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Urusei Yatsura - Miss Tomobiki o Sagase!

Wario's gameplay style is brute force mixed with elements of timing (namely jumps) and deductive reasoning. The Wario scheme of dealing with a problem is typically to barge it out of the picture in exchange for a few coins, in addition enemies can be picked up and thrown to take out other enemies or for accumulation of yet more coins.[CR]The game's levels are spread throughout a large island which is divided into a number of smaller areas in a similar way to Mario Land 2 and within these areas the individual levels are arranged in a linear path with a boss fight lying at the end. While Mario Land allowed players to tackle its areas in any order Wario Land features a linear progression throughout, which, while being more constrictive than its predecessor means the game has a much more refined difficulty arc which spans its entirety as opposed to only each individual area.[CR]Graphically, Wario Land is a drastic departure from the Mario titles available for the Game Boy and replaces the shiny and clean-looking sprites which are reminiscent of cartoon strips with grittier and darker ones in line with Wario&#8217;s character. The detail is also increased over previous games, with many more pixels dedicated to character models and locations giving the game increased clarity and overall graphical quality. [CR]Power-up Hats[CR]Bull Wario about to attack.[CR]Wario &#8211; Standard Wario, will shrink if hit by an enemy.[CR]Bull Wario &#8211; Upgraded Wario can cling to ceilings, perform floor stomps and destroy destructible blocks in one hit.[CR]Dragon Wario - A dragon hat enables Wario to shoot flames on dry land and a jet of gas underwater which damages enemies, and destroys blocks from a distance.[CR]Jet &#8211; Jet propelled hat lets Wario run faster and fly for short distances. [CR]Game Areas[CR]Rice Beach - Consists of relatively simple platforming levels which feature water and quicksand as environmental hazards. The boss is named Toge Bro. who looks like a standard Koopa with spikes that stands upright.[CR]Mt. Teapot - Mountain and cave based levels. The boss is named Beefine who is a bi-pedal bull.[CR]Sherbet Land - A secret world with ice themed levels where slippery surfaces offer added challenges. The boss is Hinyari, a penguin with spiked boxing gloves.[CR]Stove Canyon - Levels are themed around lava with collapsing bridges and many flying enemies. The boss is Funfun, a giant head with a skull on its forehead. [CR]SS Teacup - A Pirate themed level. The boss is  Bobo, a giant bird.[CR]Parsley Woods - Levels are split between trees and railroad tracks with the former consisting of standard platforming fare and the latter introducing moving train cars which add the difficulty of fighting enemies while avoiding obstacles and staying on the cars. The boss is Zenisukii, a ghost.[CR]Syrup Castle - The final area holds fiendish platforming levels where timing and pixel-perfect jumps are a necessity. Spring blocks add an extra level of challenge by vastly increasing jumping distance. The final boss is Captain Syrup and her Genie Denpu. [CR]Treasures[CR]Once you defeat the boss of the each main area, if you go back to some of the levels, they will be slightly different. There will be new doors that require a key in the level that let you collect one of 15 Treasures. The differing amount of treasures you have collected will determine your "ending". When you defeat the game it counts up the money and treasures you have collected and by how many you've collected you will receive a corresponding house. You can get a Birdhouse, Tree-house, Log Cabin, Pagoda, Castle, or a whole Planet.[CR]Game Credits[CR]Producer - Gumpei YokoiDirector - Kyotake HirojiDirector - Hosokawa TakehikoProgrammer - Yamanaka MasaruProgrammer - Ogawa YuzuruProgrammer - Hirano IsaoProgrammer - Katsuki YoshinoriGraphic Designer - Kyotake HirojiGraphic Designer - Hosokawa TakehikoGraphic Designer - Sugino KenichiMusic Composer - Yoshitomi RyojiMusic Composer - Ishikawa KozueDirector - Kiyotake HirojiDirector - Hosokawa TakehikoProgrammer - Yamanaka MasaruProgrammer - Ogawa YuzuruProgrammer - Hirano IsaoProgrammer - Katsuki Yoshinori[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Prevent yourself from losing a life[CR]As you progress through a level, if you manage to be killed by an enemy, Wario will move up in the air and then leave the screen. If you pause the screen while Wario moves up in the air, and turn off the game and subsequently restart it, you will be on the same level without a loss of a life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Six different endings[CR]When you beat the game, the ending depends on how many coins you collected in total.Wario will live in these places, depending on the coin total.Birdhouse - 300-10,071 coinsTree trunk - 10,072-40,007 coinsLog cabin - 40,008-70,007 coinsPagoda - 70,008-90,007 coinsCastle - 90,008-99,998 coinsPlanet - 99,999+ coins[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug menu[CR]During gameplay, pause, and press SELECT 16 times - no more, no less.

The invaders manage to steal all of Wario's treasure he had collected in the first Wario Land game and flood his home by leaving a large water faucet in his basement running. During the raid, the Pirate Gooms accidentally set off Wario's giant alarm clock, but make their escape before he begins stirring. Eventually Wario wakes up and figures out what Syrup and her Gooms have done, setting out to find them. He pursues the Brown Sugar Gang across the varied areas outside of his castle in the hopes of having his treasure returned and gaining his revenge against the intruders.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dungeons! Giant snakes! Giant snakes in dungeons![CR]Wario Land 2 is noticeably different from the first Wario Land game. The most notable difference is that Wario is now invulnerable, and is instead susceptible to different effects from enemy effects. For instance if an enemy stomps on Wario's head, he might be flattened, enabling him to cross gaps he might otherwise have fallen through. Of course some enemies are just nuisances and won't help Wario in any way, but regardless an enemy will never cause Wario to die. This change emphasizes puzzle solving and platforming rather than traditional survival.[CR]The game has several branching level paths that change how the game's storyline plays out, many of which have their own variation of the game's ending. Once the player has completed one of the endings, they can select any stage they have completed and see which treasures they have and have not collected. In order to see the game's "true" ending, the player has to collect every treasure available in the game and complete the entire picture panel that appears after a level is completed.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Each world, or chapter, consists of five stages and one boss (usually). With only 25 of 50 stages being available with the standard playthrough, searching for hidden level exits adds to the replayability of the game.Chapter 1: One Noisy Morning[CR]The first chapter takes place in Wario's castle and dungeon, kicking out his invaders and doing some damage control. Basic gameplay mechanics are introduced. The very first level also features the most fiendishly hidden secret level exit in the game.Chapter 2: SS Tea Cup[CR]Chapter 2 features the outskirts of Wario's Castle and a return to Captain Syrup's flagship, the SS Tea Cup. This chapter includes an escort mission, of sorts, involving Wario's prize hen, and water/nautical themed levels. The boss of the chapter is Bobo, also familiar from Wario Land 1.Chapter 3: Maze Woods[CR]A heavily forested area, several of the Maze Woods levels are arguably the most punitive, requiring above average reaction skills from the player. The Puffy Wario form is introduced, as is flying by owl.Chapter 4: In Town[CR]An urban themed environment, complete with breaking-and-entering shenanigans! Culminates in a basketball showdown with a giant rabbit, of all things.Chapter 5: Syrup Castle[CR]As the (ordinarily) final chapter, the completely rebuilt Syrup Castle is another castle environment filled with traps and hidden areas. Tricky platforming a puzzles abound, but you can finally confront Captain Syrup and her floating bomb deployment platform in an elaborate multi-stage fight! Well, okay, two stages. Requiring 2 hits each. Still, with her defeat Wario can demolish Syrup's tower a second time, and reclaim his stolen loot.Secret Chapter 1: Invade Wario CastleWario sleeps like a log.[CR]As mentioned, the entrance to the very first secret chapter is fiendishly hidden, and nearly impossible to intentionally reach. Hidden in the first level of the game, you must simply... do nothing. As Wario starts off asleep, simply refraining from touching any buttons will leave him in his slumber, ending the level soon after. In this alternate route, Wario was never awakened by his alarm clock, and Syrup's gang simply toss Wario out and move in! This exit is not reachable the first time you play the game, and can only be accessed after you beat it once, possibly adding to the confusion. The chapter is heavy on the castle theme, as ends with a showdown with Syrup and an armor-plated, radio controlled, robotic giant spear man.Secret Chapter 2: Go To The Cellar[CR]In this alternate route, following the first chapter, Wario takes a short-cut to Maze Woods through the dungeons and caves beneath his castle, meaning the levels are subterranean in theme. Most of these levels are filled with underground monsters and ghosts, although one does take place on a train very similar to the one Wario travels on during the "In Town" chapter. The area's final boss is a repeat of a fight which took place in the original Wario Land, which pits Wario against a giant bull who wants to knock him off of a platform.Secret Chapter 3: Ruins At the Bottom of the Sea[CR]If Wario stumbles upon the giant cork blocking a leak in the SS Tea Cup, he may destroy it, sinking the ship with all hands. Luckily, they are able to emerge in a series of ancient underwater ruins filled with ancient traps and ancient treasure, and so on. The chapter diverges at the fourth level, allowing Wario to continue down the standard path again or go on to the fifth level, containing a game-end boss. This time, Syrup has been captured by a nefarious self-inflatable newt, whose behind Wario kicks, along with Syrup, for good measure.Secret Chapter 4: Mysterious FactoryThis factory does not observe any occupational safety regulations.[CR]Accessible from the factory level in Town, Wario follows Syrup into her hideout in a seemingly purposeless and highly dangerous industrial complex. Get ready for some intense conveyor belt action!Secret Chapter 5: Uncanny Mansion[CR]Also an alternate route from Town, Wario tracks Syrup down in a spooky haunted mansion, filled with a number of devilish puzzles and challenges. The end boss is a slimy ghost with Syrup in his clutches. After defeating him, Wario spots his stolen treasure, but falls down a hidden trap door! Seemingly endless, Wario keeps falling until, (phew!) he wakes up in his bed. It was all a dream! And in a twist on the usual credits sequence, which shows Wario running home with his treasure, we are shown a hot air balloon with Syrup's insignia flying to Wario's castle. Looks like the dream came true.The Really Final Chapter: Steal the Syrup Treasure![CR]Collecting every single treasure and map piece unlocks the true final level: Syrup's treasure vault! A bizarre and surreal environment, this time challenge level tests every skill you've learned and introduces a couple new ones in this challenging and worthy final stage. As it turns out, the final boss is... the giant spear man. Last line of defense or the puppet master? We may never know.[CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]All wound up.[CR]While Wario may be invincible this time around, Wario Land 2 introduces many transformations that change Wario's abilities. Often the player must use these temporary forms to solve platforming challenges, or avoid gaining them to pass a room.Fat Wario[CR]After being force-fed cake by rogue chefs, Wario swells to an impressive size. His speed and jumping is severely restricted, but he now breaks blocks by simply jumping onto them, and crushes enemies underfoot.Flat Wario[CR]Being flattened by a stone idol turns Wario comically flat. He becomes defenseless but can lazily drift through the air like a sheet of paper, allowing him to cross chasms and fit into small gaps, as well as crossing holes in the floor he would otherwise fall through.Puffy Wario[CR]Wario is highly allergic to bee stings! Being stung makes Wario's face puff up and apparently fill with helium, causing him to float to the ceiling.Spring Wario[CR]Being hit by a hammer turns Wario into a human spring, turning him defenseless but allowing him to jump much higher.Zombie Wario[CR]Touching a ghost or being infected by a fellow zombie turns Wario undead. He loses the ability to jump, but can now fall through thin floors.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Boss Battles[CR]Beat the game with 100% status with all treasure and map pieces. The levels  with a boss will have a skull nearby them on the map, marked with an arrow. Choose one of these levels. Then at the name of the level screen, hold Down and press the A button. You will now go directly to the boss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 100% Completion Unlockables[CR]To get the 100% completion, get every treasure and beat every level, this includes all side-levels and then two new areas are unlocked. One is a bonus game which has nothing to do with Wario, and the other is a very tough level that times how fast you can beat it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play the hidden chapter.[CR]Start a new game without waking Wario up, let the pirates knock him out of the castle. The game will begin at a hidden chapter.</plot>		<releasedate>14/3/1998</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.7</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>P6DS1LkTEiE</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>11547</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/562638-wario-land-ii</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/wario-land-ii</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wario-land-ii/3030-13721/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/5519</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11547-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11547-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/DNS7ERF.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57466-wario-land-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67843-wario-land-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172282-wario-land-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart6>		<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/254342-wario-land-ii-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart7>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177165-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177166-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-opening-movie-wario-s-castle.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177167-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-smash-things-with-your-charge.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177169-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-turning-off-that-alarm-clock.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177170-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-wario-gets-burned.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177171-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-and-becomes-fire-wario-who.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177173-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-this-guy-is-blocking-wario.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177174-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-until-wario-chucks-another.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177175-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-turn-off-the-faucet.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/177176-wario-land-ii-game-boy-screenshot-swimming-for-treasure.jpg</snapshot10>		<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11547-1.jpg</fanart1>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/oeKQRFU.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Water World (Europe)">		<description>Water World (Europe)</description>		<rom crc="4786FD6E" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FWater%20World%20%28Europe%29.zip" sha1="E669D47B124A1E12D73F4AC80D8B4C0F917CB058" size="186711" />		<title_clean>Water World</title_clean>		<plot>The sun.

The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase.  The wheel can be "spun" at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain.[CR]Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer.  Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize.  Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases.[CR]There is even a "sexy model" that animates out onto the "stage"--though the resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited time[CR]Use the following actions to bypass the timer during game play and allow easier puzzle solving. When spinning the wheel, highlight the ''Spin'' option and hold A. When buying a vowel, highlight the ''Buy'' option and hold A. When solving a puzzle, select ''Solve'', then highlight ''Del'' and hold A.

"Where is Timbucktoo?" - "Between Timbuck One and Timbuck Three").[CR]During the latter portions of the game, the player will be allowed to enter Toon Town, where they can continue tracking down clues to clear Roger's name, and prepare for the final showdown with Judge Doom.[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version was developed independently by Capcom, and was a completely different game, and much more polished, casting the player as Roger Rabbit himself in what can only be called an open world adventure game. Players were tasked with hunting down items, interrogating characters, simple combat and otherwise doing wild things to get Roger out of trouble.

In various side-scrolling levels, Kuros must dodge obstacles such as arrows and flames as well as kill different enemies such as bats, spiders, warriors and skeletons. To damage his enemies, Kuros can use two different attacks: a fast stab attack and a strike that is slower, but has a better range. Various items that help Kuros on his quest, can be picked up throughout the levels: gems increase the player's score and grant extra lives, food replenishes some health, a spell of invincebility makes Kuros tempoarily invincible and keys are used to open treasure chests or doors. Kuros can also find additional equipment including a "Shield of Protection" that halves the damage he receives and the "Boots of Jumping" that let him jump higher and fall from high platforms without taking damage.[CR]Levels are divided into several sub-levels. At the last sub-level, a boss-fight awaits Kuros.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/wizards-warriors-chapter-x-the-fortress-of-fear[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gain Six Lives[CR]Finsh a game and make it on the high score screen, then enter your initials as: W, [Heart], W.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1990</releasedate>		<year>1990</year>		<genre>Platform</genre>		<studio>Acclaim</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Platform</perspective>		<rating>3.3</rating>		<videoid>PL7MFtXr5mQ</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13068</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585719-fortress-of-fear-wizards-and-warriors-x</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/wizards-warriors-x-the-fortress-of-fear</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wizards-warriors-chapter-x-the-fortress-of-fear/3030-24474/</giantbomb_url>		<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/11723</consolegrid_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13068-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/F0EcIlA.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/19qtblu.png</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/179863-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363099-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363100-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363101-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363102-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-found.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363103-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-killing.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363104-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-a.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363105-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-found.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363106-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-attacking.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363107-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/363108-wizards-warriors-x-fortress-of-fear-game-boy-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot10>		<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/kDl0Ueg.png</banner1>	</game>	<game name="Wordtris (USA)">		<description>Wordtris (USA)</description>		<rom crc="075A8231" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FWordtris%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="AB68498646FB2CA1DF9443E6A80062C30B3EA4F9" size="81560" />		<title_clean>Wordtris</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wordtris requires the player to match words like in Boggle or Scrabble, while facing the elements of block breaking.

Arts based on the event. Electronic Arts bought the rights to use the FIFA name, teams and players. It is the first World Cup game played in 3D rather than a 2D perspective. The game also used the same graphics engine that was featured in the previously released FIFA Road to the World Cup.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Real teams and players were featured in the gameThe game contained many elements of the World Cup, and this adds realism to the game. Every player and team at the time is featured in the game with realistic stats. There are exhibition, World Cup, Road to the World Cup, tournament and multiplayer modes. You could also customize teams and players to create the team you want to use. The game can be played in many different perspectives. The camera can be moved to a traditional birds eye perspective or it could be zoomed in to show off the 3D graphics.  Shootout is an event that can break a tieYou will always be in control of the player who has the ball on offense. To defend you can cycle through players, but the game will often give you control to the proper man. Games will often end in draws, but you are able to choose sudden death or shoot out modes to break the tie. The game featured authenthic commentarry and licensed music. Real life announcers recorded a large amount of commentary to be used in the play by play of the game. Licensed music was usually featured throughout many of the game menus.  An interesting mode included in the game was Classic. In this mode you put in famous World Cup scenarios, and you are to meet requirements to beat it. There were many inconsistencies in the mode, but it did loosly follow the real life events.

Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Action, Sports</genre>		<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>		<thegamesdb_id>24134</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569856-world-cup-usa-94</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/world-cup-usa-94</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/world-cup-usa-94/3030-5498/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/4/48222/1481626-916011_88090_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/24134-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203113-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203114-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-here-comes-the-mascot.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203115-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-language-selection.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203116-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203117-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-team-selection.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203118-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-and-the-next-match-is.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203119-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-kick-off.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203120-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-the-referee-blows-his.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203121-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-good-chance-in-the-penalty.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/203122-world-cup-usa-94-game-boy-screenshot-and-he-scores.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="World Heroes 2 Jet (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">		<description>World Heroes 2 Jet (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>		<rom crc="67303954" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FWorld%20Heroes%202%20Jet%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28SGB%20Enhanced%29.zip" sha1="3C5F213104E1BF968A01E0CFFBE7B5B5120E0458" size="254479" />		<title_clean>World Heroes 2 Jet</title_clean>		<plot>World Heroes 2 JET is the third game in the World Heroes series.

/>		<title_clean>Worms</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Worms' Main Menu (DOS)[CR]Originally created by Andy Davidson for the Amiga, and later ported to a variety of other systems by Team17, Worms is the first iteration of the long-running Worms series of turn-based strategic artillery games. As in subsequent games, the goal of Worms is to use a team of well-armed annelids to kill worms of opposing human or A.I. players; in each round, the last player with living worms is declared the winner. Worms was first published by Ocean Software Ltd. in 1995, and in addition to its original platform, it has appeared on the Amiga CD32, PC, Game Boy, Genesis, Jaguar, Macintosh, PlayStation, Saturn, and SNES; in fact, it has been ported to more systems than any other Worms game. A version of the title was even considered for Nintendo's Virtual Boy at one point, though Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown stated in 2008 that the Virtual Boy port never truly made it into the development stages due to a sentiment that the platform was "doomed to failure".[CR]The DOS version of Worms was followed up by Worms: Reinforcements, an expansion to the original game, in late 1995; the following year Worms and Reinforcements would be released as a single package under the name Worms United. Worms would later be released on Steam in 2011 and GOG.com in 2012, though in both cases the version sold is Worms United, not the original game. After completing Worms Davidson would also head up the development of Worms: The Director's Cut, released in 1997, which was an Amiga-exclusive version of Worms that featured a large number of new weapons and game options not previously seen in other iterations of the game, many of which were adopted in Worms 2, released the same year. Both 2006's Worms: Open Warfare and 2007's Worms are considered remakes of the original Worms due in large part to similarities in their weapon loadouts.[CR]Development[CR]Worms was originally conceived not as a commercial product, but as a distraction for creator Andy Davidson, a fan of local multiplayer games like Bomberman and Super Mario Kart, and his high school friends. It was initially built using borrowed assets from Psygnosis' Lemmings, and the earliest version of Worms was known as Lemartillery as a result. The game eventually became so popular among the students of Davidson's school that it was banned entirely, prompting Davidson to consider the possibility of having his game published. In order to make the game more attractive to would-be publishers, however, the game's graphics had to be reworked, and thus Davidson scrapped the original lemmings on favor of worms, giving this new iteration the name Total Wormage. Davidson was so intent on getting his game published that after high school he decided to forgo the pursuit of higher education in order to do so. While he continued to work on the game, Davidson used the customers of an Amiga store where he worked as a form of playtesting for Total Wormage.[CR]In one of his efforts to get his game noticed, Davidson submitted Total Wormage into a competition held by Amiga Format, a British Amiga magazine. By Davidson's own admission, though, his entry into the contest did not accomplish what he had hoped, as he neither won nor received any mention in the magazine. Although discouraged by this and a number of failed attempts at garnering attention for Total Wormage by mailing copies to publishers and developers, Davidson had one final idea: to take the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London. This would prove to be the turning point in Davidson's fortunes, as while there he demoed the game to Team17, who showed an immediate interest in it. Team17 offered to help Davidson develop and publish the game; much of their work went into porting Worms to other game systems, as the original Amiga version that Davidson had been working on was by this time fairly well-developed. In total, Davidson estimates that he spent about four years of his life in the development of Worms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Worms consists of actions taken by between two and four teams of human- or A.I.-controlled worms on a two-dimensional playing field. The game is turn-based, with each player being able to move a single worm per turn; turns typically end once a worm has either fired a weapon or sustained damage, although they can also end automatically if the allotted time for a turn runs out. From there, play shifts to the next player in the sequence, which is determined randomly at the beginning of gameplay, and that player proceeds in the same fashion. The objective of worms at all times is to cause as much damage to enemy worms as possible while also preserving one's own worms. Each worms starts the round with a certain amount of hit points (typically one hundred), and if their hit points are reduced to zero, they will die, leaving behind a gravestone and creating a small explosion that can harm nearby worms. Worms can also be killed instantaneously by being knocked outside the boundaries of the level or into liquid substances that reside at the bottom of the stage. If a player loses all four of their worms, they are eliminated, and the winner of a given round is the player that survives the match without being eliminated.A Banana Bomb causing widespread destruction. At top, opposing players' health bars can be seen; within the lower HUD, a wind strength indicator (top right) and power bar (bottom right) are visible.[CR]Each player starts the match with an assortment of armaments and utilities in order to aid them in their goal of dominating their opposition. This includes staple weapons such as bazookas and grenades, which can be used frequently, to more powerful weaponry such as homing missiles and dynamite that can only be used a finite number of times. Worms also contains a handful of "super weapons" such as banana bombs and explosive sheep, which can only be obtained through periodic weapon crate drops during a match; these items are extremely potent, though incredibly rare to find. Some weapons require that the player be able to accurately gauge the proper weapon trajectory and launch power necessary to hit a target, which can be further complicated by the inclusion of wind conditions that can affect certain projectiles while in flight. In addition to weapons, Worms also offers a number of movement utilities designed more for defense or traversal than offense; this includes items like ninja ropes and teleporters, which allow different ways of moving around the environment, and items like blow torches and pneumatic drills that can carve through obstructions.[CR]Environments in Worms are completely destructible, and almost all weapons cause some amount of deformation to the terrain. Over time, this reduces the size of the overall play area, making defensive positioning increasingly difficult while simultaneously increasing the danger that players will fall or be forced off of the map. In order to help make the game more replayable, levels in Worms are also randomly generated, and prior to a match players can cycle through maps indefinitely until they find one to their liking. Several other aspects of the game are adjustable as well, though not all of these variables have a dramatic affect on gameplay. Team and individual worm names can be changed, starting hit point totals can be set between seventy-five and five hundred points, and the intelligence level of A.I. opponents can be tweaked. The availability of all of the game's default weapons can be tailored to suit personal tastes, and Sudden Death, a late-game stalemate breaker that reduces all worms to one hit point, can be made to occur sooner, later, or not at all. A number of other variables exist as well, such as default worm placement and turn length, and an optional Banzai mode is also included which makes explosions even more destructive.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The Worms arsenal includes more than twenty weapons and utilities that vary in strength and purpose. All but three of these tools are given automatically to the player during a match, while the others are designated as "super weapons," and must be collected from randomized weapon crates (although these crates can also contain other weapons or booby traps). A wide variety of different armaments are represented in Worms, including melee weapons, firearms, and a variety of explosives that may be thrown, dropped, propelled by rockets, or conveyed in less-than-orthodox ways. Some usable items are classified as utilities, and while these objects may cause damage to enemies in some cases, the intent of utility items is generally to offer worms additional mobility or defensive options. Weapons can be selected either by right-clicking in order to bring up a weapon selection panel or by hitting their associated function key.BazookaBazookaDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 One of the go-to weapons of Worms, the Bazooka fires a single explosive shell in a trajectory and at a velocity determined by the player. Provided that it successfully finds its target, it does a solid amount of damage and causes a fair amount of concussive force as well. It also destroys a sizable chunk of the surrounding landscape. Bazooka usage is unlimited by default, and it can be extremely useful to skilled players. Its course is heavily influenced by wind, however, requiring some amount of compensation in gusty conditions.Homing MissileHoming MissileDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 (2x) The Homing Missile is similar to the Bazooka in many respects, though it has one crucial difference. Prior to being fired, the player is able to select a point on the map that the Homing Missile will zero in on after it takes flight. Though it's tracking capability is far from perfect, with foresight it can be used to hit almost any target that is not hidden underground. Due to the increased accuracy over the Bazooka, it is easier to propel worms in a desired direction with it, though just like the Bazooka it is affected by wind.GrenadeGrenadeDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F2 Being equal in strength to the Bazooka, the Grenade is another of Worms' staple weapons, and similarly it is a deadly weapon in the hands of a seasoned player. One of the Grenade's main advantages is the fact that it is not affected by wind at all, and thus two Grenades thrown at the same angle and strength will always have the same trajectory. A Grenade also does not explode on impact, but instead possesses an adjustable fuse that automatically detonates it after a preselected number of seconds (between one and five).Cluster BombCluster BombDamage: Up to 25 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Cluster Bomb takes after the Grenade in terms of its low susceptibility to wind and adjustable fuse length. Once the fuse is detonated, it splits into five distinct explosives that scatter and fall to the ground, causing additional damage to any worms within a short vicinity of the initial blast. While each individual explosion is less damaging than the force of a Grenade, combined they can cause far greater damage. The natural target for a Cluster Bomb is not a single worm but a gathering of enemy worms situated fairly close to each other.Banana BombBanana BombDamage: Up to 75 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Banana Bomb can be thought of as a version of the Cluster Bomb, though a far more destructive one. After a Banana Bomb has been thrown and its timer expires, five deadly bananas are unleashed that fly into the air and explode immediately upon contact with the ground. Each banana is akin to a single stick of Dynamite, and the combined detonation can kill several worms, or even an entire team of worms, relatively easily. Due to its potentially enormous area of effect, the Banana Bomb is a frequent source of self-injury.ShotgunShotgunDamage: Up to 25 HP per shotHotkey: F3 The Shotgun is one of three point-and-shoot firearm weapons in Worms, and its main distinction over its brethren is the ability to shoot twice in a single turn. Even though the damage it causes with each shot is somewhat on the low side, it affords some strategic possibilities that are not possible with other weapons. A player can use it, for example, to attack two different worms in a single turn even if they are not close to one another; alternately, it can be used to attack once before using the remainder of the turn to seek a defensive position.UziUziDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) Using the Uzi unleashes a short stream of bullets in a specified direction. If all hits connect, it causes a significant amount of damage, and there are other benefits to the weapon as well, as it creates a significant amount of pushback that can be used to propel enemy worms into hazards such as mines or water. The downside of this property is that it is at times difficult to get the maximum amount of damage from the weapon. Perhaps the best way to ensure this is to use the Uzi against enemies that have their backs against a wall.MinigunMinigunDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) The Minigun is essentially a more deadly version of the Uzi, and as such its applications are fairly similar. Like the Uzi, it is unlikely that all bullets will hit their target unless said worm is pinned against a solid surface, though the damage boost of the Minigun makes this drawback less of an issue. It is an extremely good tool for pushing worms around the landscape and into peril. Because of its wide bullet spread, the Minigun is best used from close range, though care should be taken, as it is possible to damage oneself with it.Fire PunchFire PunchDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 Upon activating the Fire Punch ability, a worm will unleash a Street Fighter-inspired Dragon Punch that damages an opponent and sends them flying across the map. The trajectory of the Fire Punch's knockback is arguably its most advantageous attribute, as the actual injury caused by the attack is somewhat modest. More often than not, the Fire Punch is either used to knock an opponent off of a precipice, hopefully to their death, or as a stylish way of finishing off a worm that is nearly dead already. It can also strike worms above the player.Dragon BallDragon BallDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 (2x) The Dragon Ball ability creates a short-range fireball that damages the first worm it touches. It is similar to the Fire Punch in many ways, and even does the same amount of damage on hit, though it is more horizontally oriented. This goes not only for the attack itself, which travels horizontally as opposed to the Fire Punch's vertical movement, but also the result of the attack. Enemies hit by a Dragon Ball will be thrown a great distance but will not gain much altitude, which can be used to great effect to push worms into mines or water.DynamiteDynamiteDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 A simple yet undeniably powerful weapon, the Dynamite stick is a dropped explosive device with an extremely large blast radius. Since it must be placed manually, the user is required afterwards to beat a hasty retreat lest they fall victim to their own destructive predilections. It leaves a very large crater in its wake, and any worms within its range when it detonates sustain heavy damage. Dynamite is the most potent weapon in Worms that is not considered to be a "super weapon," and by default it is available in very limited supply.MineMineDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Deployed in the same manner as the Dynamite stick, the Mine may be a step down in terms of power, but it has uses that Dynamite does not. It can of course be placed directly on top of a worm so that it will activate and explode immediately, but it can also be used as a defensive tool, which can be particularly useful in securing underground tunnels. Against A.I opponents, its defensive utility is somewhat diminished, as computer worms tend to move around far less than human ones, reducing the chances of mine activation significantly.SheepSheepDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Seemingly innocuous at a glance, the Sheep is in truth one of the deadliest weapons in Worms. Once released, the Sheep will amble along while trying to bound over any obstacles it might encounter. When the fire button is pressed a second time, the Sheep will detonate, creating a blast equal to Dynamite in terms of its size and lethality. The Sheep negates one of the primary drawbacks of Dynamite, that being that players must place it themselves; Sheep can have some difficulty navigating uneven terrain, though, so flat surfaces work best.Air StrikeAir StrikeDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F6 Calling in an Air Strike orders an aircraft to perform a bombing run over a targeted area. When initiated, the player is asked to select a target zone in a manner similar to the target selection of the Homing Missile; in the case of the Air Strike, the selected point is then used as the bull's eye for an immediate missile bombardment. Explosives fall in a fairly large area around the target, making it an attractive way to cause heavy damage to a large cluster of worms, though it does require a fairly clear path to its target in order to be effective.TeleportTeleportDamage: NoneHotkey: F6 (2x) The Worms equivalent of a Get Out of Jail Free card, the Teleport instantaneously transports a single worm to any point on the map the player so desires. This can be used in situations where a worm is surrounded by hostile worms, and it is also a popular way to collect weapon crates. Using a teleport immediately ends the worm's turn, so it is important to ensure that doing so will not leave the player vulnerable to attack in subsequent turns. As the most powerful movement tool in the game, its use is severely restricted by default.Blow TorchBlow TorchDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 The Blow Torch allows a worm to carve into the environment either horizontally or at an angle. While it does cause a pittance of damage to worms in its path, the primary purpose of the Blow Torch is in tunneling through the map to reach new areas or building underground defensive structures that shield worms against attack. This is a particularly vexing problem for opposing worms, as burrowed worms can't be attacked easily in many scenarios, often forcing players to waste several turns in an attempt to infiltrate or destroy enemy defenses.DrillDrillDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 (2x) Unlike the Blow Torch, the Drill burrows into the environment in only one direction: down. Though this is not intended for offensive purposes, it has more damage potential than the Blow Torch, as a worm can in some cases become stuck in the hole created by the Drill and continue to take damage. Unfortunately, worms who use the Drill to escape enemy fire are more vulnerable to attack than those hidden in horizontal tunnels. This is because it is a fairly simple matter to drop a Grenade, Cluster Bomb, or other ordinance on their heads.Ninja RopeNinja RopeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 Aside from walking and jumping, the Ninja Rope is arguably the most important means of locomotion in Worms. Casting a Ninja Rope will attach a worm to any solid surface via rope, and from there the player is free to extend and retract the rope and also swing back and forth to gain momentum. In this way players are able to rapidly traverse large sections of the map and access areas that might otherwise be inaccessible. Most importantly, using the Ninja Rope does not end the player's turn, leaving worms free to attack their foes afterwards.BungeeBungeeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 (2x) Having the Bungee utility selected allows the player the freedom to walk off of cliffs without fear of sustaining fall damage. Dropping from a precipice activates the item automatically, and from there the player can control their movements on the Bungee cord. It behaves somewhat like a springier version of the Ninja Rope, and like the Ninja Rope the player can detach from it at any time by hitting the fire button. The player's turn does not end once the worm dismounts the cord, so the remainder of their turn can be played out as normal.GirderGirderDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 Offering a number of strategic possibilities, the Girder utility is the only usable item in Worms that creates a terrain feature rather than destroying one. Using a Girder allows the player to place a long solid metal beam that acts like all other solid objects in the game. For allied worms, this can be a useful means of protection or a way to assist mobility, and it can also be used as a way to restrict the movements of enemy worms. Girders can have their orientation rotated at will and their size adjusted prior to being placed on the map.KamikazeKamikazeDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F10 True to its name, the Kamikaze attack is a one-way proposition for any worm that chooses to utilize it. The idea is that the worm in question will fly forth and explode violently, causing damage to enemy worms while sending them flying. Since worms are the player's most valued resource, it is a tool to be avoided if at all possible. The ideal candidate for a Kamikaze attack is a worm that is near death and would likely die before their next turn anyway. Even so, it is usually only worth considering if the blast will affect multiple worms.ProdProdDamage: NoneHotkey: F11 The Prod is the ultimate Worms insult: an attack that does no damage. By standing next to another worm and issuing a Prod command, the player's worm will give a gently nudge to the adjacent worm that will push them forward ever so slightly. Nothing more, nothing less. The only practical application of this ability is in the event that an enemy worm can be pushed off of or into something, and even then there are weapons that can accomplish the same while also causing damage directly. It is used primarily to humiliate an opponent.Skip GoSkip GoDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 (2x) As it implies, Skip Go allows a player to prematurely end their worm's turn without taking any further action. This can be useful if a worm has no viable means of attack or if the player simply wishes to force their opponent's hand. If a worm is burrowed safely underground, for instance, a player might decide to skip their turn rather than risk retaliation by leaving and going on the offensive. Skipping a turn also has the effect of allowing more turns before the onset of Sudden Death, which is activated based on play time rather than turn count.SurrenderSurrenderDamage: NoneHotkey: F10 (2x) By selecting Surrender and pressing the fire button a player can at any point raise the proverbial white flag and remove themselves from play voluntarily. In a two-player match, this ends the round automatically, though if two or more players remain after a Surrender then play will continue until only one team remains. It should be noted that surrendered worms will remain on the playing field even after they are no longer in competition; aside from their lack of any agency in the match, these worms behave as they normally would.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Worms was fairly well-received upon its release in 1995, and many critics commending it for having easy-to-grasp yet strategic gameplay, a humorous, lighthearted presentation, and a great deal of customization options and replayability. The original version received a great deal of positive attention from the Amiga gaming press, with a large number of review scores falling within the ninetieth percentile. Ironically, Amiga Format, the very same British publication that had failed to acknowledge Davidson's game when he submitted it into their yearly Amiga game competition, issued a glowing post-release review of Worms in their 1995 Christmas issue, saying that it "thoroughly deserves to be a real smash."[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1995</releasedate>		<year>1995</year>		<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>		<studio>Ocean Software Ltd.</studio>		<nplayers>1-4 Alt</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<thegamesdb_id>17673</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/199335-worms</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/worms</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/worms/3030-2007/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17673-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210319-worms-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/210320-worms-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30292-worms-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381072-worms-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen-and-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381073-worms-game-boy-screenshot-select-what-type-of-match-to-play.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381074-worms-game-boy-screenshot-playfield-wormlife.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381075-worms-game-boy-screenshot-i-am-using-the-bazooka-and-can-fire.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381076-worms-game-boy-screenshot-boom-we-were-hit.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381077-worms-game-boy-screenshot-this-is-the-damage-we-took-after.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381078-worms-game-boy-screenshot-vasquez-is-out.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381079-worms-game-boy-screenshot-well-at-least-he-gets-a-tombstone.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381080-worms-game-boy-screenshot-weapon-drop.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/381081-worms-game-boy-screenshot-the-team-oh-no-wins-this-round.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="WWF King of the Ring (USA, Europe)">		<description>WWF King of the Ring (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="7F0CD87C" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FWWF%20King%20of%20the%20Ring%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="FD17015D8F85F407427C8AA3E68FB0A32DC072A8" size="98347" />		<title_clean>WWF King of the Ring</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF King of the Ring is a wrestling game developed by Eastridge Technology and published by LJN for the NES and Game Boy platforms.[CR]Featured Wrestlers[CR]Hulk Hogan ( Speed: 4 Strength: 7 Stamina: 5)"Macho Man" Randy Savage (Speed: 5 Strength: 4 Stamina: 7)Bret Hart (Speed: 6 Strength: 4 Stamina: 6)The Undertaker (Speed: 4 Strength: 6 Stamina: 6)"The Narcissist" Lex Luger (Speed: 3 Strength: 7 Stamina: 5)Mr Perfect (Speed: 6 Strength: 4 Stamina: 5)Razor Ramon (Speed: 3 Strength: 7 Stamina: 5)Shawn Michaels (Speed: 6 Strength: 3 Stamina: 6)Yokozuna (Speed: 3 Strength: 7 Stamina: 4) [Not featured in GB version]Bam Bam Bigelow (Speed: 4 Strength: 6 Stamina: 4) [Not featured in GB version]"You" (A customizable character in terms of name and attributes)[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]One player modes:[CR]- One on one[CR]- Tag team[CR]- Tournament (You take on a ladder of all the in game wrestlers to win the WWF Championship)[CR]- King of the Ring (A single elimination tournament with the winner being declared King of the Ring)Two player modes:[CR]- One on one[CR]- Tag Team (Versus only, no co-op)[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,6,6 and 7 out of ten. Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score, wrote, "...There are lots of wrestlers to pipick from, each being quite different from the other. Being only a two-button game does not really hinder it from being fun, but being on an 8-bit system does have its limitations -- like the occasional character [having his] legs disappearing when thrown...".[CR]Sushi-X wrote, "...The graphics are weak and lots of flicker gets annoying real fast. The game play is decent and the cart proves to be fun with two players".[CR]Development[CR]WWF King of the Ring was the last NES/GB game made by Gray Matter.[CR]During development Hulk Hogan complained about his player character's hairline so the developers added pixels to his sprite. When he complained again the developers gave him a comically full head of hair. This changed was approved.[CR]The game used two wrestler body types: fat and non-fat. One unnamed wrestler complained he had been placed in the wrong category, so he had to be remade as a non-fat character.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/9/1993</releasedate>		<year>1993</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>LJN</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<videoid>pIDOuNDsJdc</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>11163</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563304-wwf-king-of-the-ring</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/wwf-king-of-the-ring</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-king-of-the-ring/3030-10177/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362625-nes_wwfkingofthering.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11163-1.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286404-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286405-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286406-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-choose-wrestler.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286407-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-randy-savage-vs-bret.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286408-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-randy-sleep-like.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286409-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-legend-fight-with.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286410-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-hbk-get-a-slap-in.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286411-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-bret-wins.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286412-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-mr-perfect-against.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286413-wwf-king-of-the-ring-game-boy-screenshot-razor-ramon-crying.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="WWF Raw (USA, Europe)">		<description>WWF Raw (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="1889552F" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FWWF%20Raw%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="03EB3A9A2AF1E24E7DE9DE21A13DC677F46B06CE" size="162889" />		<title_clean>WWF Raw</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF Raw is a wrestling game developed by  Sculptured Software and published by  Acclaim or LJN for multiple platforms.

The Nintendo 64 version of the game also included Royal Rumble and gauntlet matches. Much like modern wrestling games, the player uses a combination of buttons to punch, kick, and grapple their opponents. Also, during some of the matches, you can set the mode to hardcore and use weapons which are available.[CR]Career Mode[CR]The single player "WWF Challenge" mode consists of a pyramid of television sets that the player starts at the bottom of. In each set is a different wrestler in the WWE, and as the pyramid goes higher, so does the difficulty of the matches. After the player has defeated his opponent, often that same opponent would issue a "grudge match." These "grudge match" challenges were not optional and were prefaced by a full-motion video of the challenger. After you win the WWF championship, you defend the title and, if you suffer a loss, you need to win the title again.[CR]The Game Boy version of the game features a password save system.[CR]Playable Rosters[CR]Nintendo 64 and Playstation VersionsAhmed Johnson Bret Hart British Bulldog Faarooq GoldustHeadbanger MoshHeadbanger Thrasher Kane Ken Shamrock Mankind Owen Hart The Rock Shawn Michaels Stone Cold Steve Austin Triple H The Undertaker Cactus Jack (Secret Character) Dude Love (Secret Character)Pamela (Secret Character)Rattlesnake (Secret Character)Sue (Secret Character)Trainer (Secret Character)Turok (Secret Character; can only be unlocked using a GameShark)[CR]Commentators Vince McMahon Jim RossGame Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of the game features a smaller roster than the console counterparts.Shawn MichaelsKaneKen Shamrock"Stone Cold" Steve AustinFaarooqGoldustTriple HMankindOwen HartThe RockThe British BulldogAhmed JohnsonThe Undertaker [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level 1: Kane[CR]To skip to Kane's 1st level, enter [B]JHRFOHK[/B] on the Password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level 1: Kane[CR]To skip to Mankind's 1st level, enter [B]DHRFDGJ[/B] on the Password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level 1: Kane[CR]Enter these at the password screen from the main menu</plot>		<releasedate>14/6/1998</releasedate>		<year>1998</year>		<genre>Sports</genre>		<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>		<rating>1.1</rating>		<thegamesdb_id>23343</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563197-wwf-war-zone</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/wwf-war-zone</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-war-zone/3030-18801/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23343-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/23343-1.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/179903-wwf-war-zone-nintendo-64-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/99837-wwf-war-zone-playstation-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/87687-wwf-war-zone-playstation-media.jpg</boxart5>		<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/236701-wwf-war-zone-playstation-media.jpg</boxart6>		<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/23343-1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406508-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-start-menu.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406509-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406510-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-character-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406511-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-the-rock.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406513-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-the-rock-model.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406512-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-training-options.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406514-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-training-mode.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406515-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-creating-a-wrestler.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/406516-wwf-war-zone-playstation-screenshot-the-rock-biography.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="X (USA) (Proto)">		<description>X (USA) (Proto)</description>		<rom crc="CD555712" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FX%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" sha1="B1C5B60B82AAA0B824F7BF67FC8F111377CCFB6A" size="77840" />		<title_clean>X</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X is a Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Argonaut Games co-developed title for the Game Boy. Using a first-person viewpoint, the player goes on various missions while often employing space shooter gameplay conventions. X is historically notable because it was the first game on the system which used a truly a three-dimensional environment; simplistic polygons are thusly rendered in-game. This was accomplished despite beliefs that the system couldn't handle anything of the sort. The game was created by Dylan Cuthbert, a man who would later on contribute greatly to the development of Star Fox 1 and 2, as well as head Q-Games, the studio behind the PixelJunk series. X was also the first game that longtime Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka worked on, with his signature song being a hidden easter egg in the game. The game received a sequel in 2010 called X-Scape on DSiWare which was released worldwide.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]X's gameplay consists mainly of the player piloting a multipurpose tankas they navigate the game's polygonal environments to fight enemies and accomplish objectives. The tank has four levels of speed that can be toggled by hitting up on the D-Pad, with only the highest level, turbo, requiring the player to hold the up arrow in order to maintain that speed. Otherwise, the player can select a speed and the tank will automatically move forward while other navigational and attacking needs are addressed. Pressing down on the D-Pad naturally stops the tank and puts it in reverse when held down.[CR]The tank itself can also be modified to hold different types of equipment, thereby changing the way it's operated and used. In addition, it can enter flight mode by speeding off ramps that are placed in the game. Although in most instances the player can choose when to fly or stay on the ground, transitional sequences in which the player goes to a separate part of the world require that the player flies as they wind their way around obstacles. A fuel meter is also present and can be filled by acquiring gas from defeated enemies.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>29/5/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>		<studio>Nintendo</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569786-x</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/x</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/x/3030-23931/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149200/2235800-x.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/8/3/306283_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533081-x-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533082-x-game-boy-screenshot-the-story.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533083-x-game-boy-screenshot-on-the-field.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533084-x-game-boy-screenshot-tutorial-instructions.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533085-x-game-boy-screenshot-more-instructions.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533086-x-game-boy-screenshot-at-last-something-to-blast.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/533087-x-game-boy-screenshot-only-debris-left.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/7/2/gfs_7505_1_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/a/2/gfs_7505_1_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/1/2/gfs_7505_1_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Xenon 2 - Megablast (USA, Europe)">		<description>Xenon 2 - Megablast (USA, Europe)</description>		<rom crc="DE398678" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FXenon%202%20-%20Megablast%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" sha1="00D76805E1EF3FE0EB5E8FC045CC22DECFBE216B" size="83323" />		<title_clean>Xenon 2 - Megablast</title_clean>		<plot>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature.

The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park and has hidden them in 12 safes throughout the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).[CR]The gameplay is fairly simply, using Yogi the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen and to kill certain enemies they must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them and avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.[CR]There are no true power-ups, instead there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage that when the player picks up a 100 of them will get an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled "1-UP" that will give the player and can pick items to refill their health. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When the player enters these safes they must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold, collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/yogi-bears-goldrush[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the Start/Options prompt on the title screen, enter Up, Down, Left, Right, Right, Right, Up, Down, Right, Left, Left, Left, B.If you did it right, the level select will appear on the title screen instead of sending you to the options screen.Push Up and Down to select a level and push Start to begin.</plot>		<releasedate>14/12/1994</releasedate>		<year>1994</year>		<genre>Platform</genre>		<studio>GameTek</studio>		<videoid>-ub57R_1ZTM</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>21815</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585998-yogi-bears-goldrush</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21815-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/6/9/46969_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/1/8/gfs_38787_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/c/8/gfs_38787_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/6/8/gfs_38787_1_4.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/8/5/gfs_38787_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/5/gfs_38787_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/e/5/gfs_38787_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/f/5/gfs_38787_2_4.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/4/5/gfs_38787_2_5.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/9/5/gfs_38787_2_6.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/2/5/gfs_38787_2_7.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Yomihon Yumegoyomi - Tenjin Kaisen 2 (Japan)">		<description>Yomihon Yumegoyomi - Tenjin Kaisen 2 (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="211C4611" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FYomihon%20Yumegoyomi%20-%20Tenjin%20Kaisen%202%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="781BB266B4C9AA59A2DB4C278D2D2FE41A60EBB2" size="138760" />		<title_clean>Yomihon Yumegoyomi - Tenjin Kaisen 2</title_clean>		<plot>Tenjin Kaisen 2: Yomihon Yumegoyomi is an Adventure game, developed by Kaze and published by Meldac,which was released in Japan in 1992.</plot>		<releasedate>13/3/1992</releasedate>		<year>1992</year>		<genre>Adventure, Miscellaneous</genre>		<studio>Kaze</studio>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/569728-tenjin-kaisen-2-yomihon-yumegoyomi</gamefaqs_url>		<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/5/0/306250_front.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/5/0/306250_back.jpg</boxart2>		<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/1/1/gfs_8059_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/c/1/gfs_8059_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/7/1/gfs_8059_1_3.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/6/1/gfs_8059_1_4.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/d/1/gfs_8059_1_5.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/8/c/gfs_8059_2_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/c/gfs_8059_2_2.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/e/c/gfs_8059_2_3.jpg</snapshot8>	</game>	<game name="Yoshi (USA)">		<description>Yoshi (USA)</description>		<rom crc="F2F4BCCA" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FYoshi%20%28USA%29.zip" sha1="1B6E41C2270CE67E6FE15CC4977EF2DEBDD6E6CE" size="32181" />		<title_clean>Yoshi</title_clean>		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yoshi was released for the NES and Game Boy systems, and later Released on the 3DS Virtual Console via the Ambassador Program. It played much like Tetris, in that you were assigned to eliminate objects that endlessly fell from the sky. The player is able to choose to play as either Mario or Luigi, who were the on-screen characters who moved the stacks of enemies back and forth two at a time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Goombas, Piranha Plants, Boo Buddies, and Bloopers all rain from the sky. They can be eliminated by pairing up two identical characters at a time. Enemies can only be removed by lining them up vertically, there are no horizontal eliminations. Extra points can be earned and space can quickly be created by sandwiching enemies between the top and bottom halves of Yoshi eggs. Depending on how many enemies are placed between the eggshells; larger Yoshis can be created, as follows:Small Yoshi - No enemies, 50 points.Tall Yoshi - Between one and four enemies, 100 points.Winged Yoshi - Five or six enemies, 200 points.Star Yoshi - Seven enemies, 500 points.[CR]There are also two different gameplay modes and a multiplayer mode:Mode A - The game's endless mode, start with a clean slate and play until you run out of space in a column and lose.Mode B - The game's round clear mode, eliminate all of the enemies on a screen to earn a bonus and move on to the next round. Each stage starts with a greater number of enemies on it.Multiplayer - Compete to see which player can complete their stage the fastest, or who can at least survive the longest.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Yoshi was poorly rated by the video game press when it was re-released on the Virtual Console, reviewers felt that it was too unoriginal and similar to other puzzle games.[CR]</plot>		<releasedate>14/7/1992</releasedate>		<year>1991</year>		<genre>Action</genre>		<studio>Nintendo of America Inc.</studio>		<nplayers>1</nplayers>		<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>		<rating>3.2</rating>		<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>		<videoid>iyE-3E6xzJw</videoid>		<thegamesdb_id>13129</thegamesdb_id>		<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563308-yoshi</gamefaqs_url>		<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy/yoshi</mobygames_url>		<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/yoshi/3030-19197/</giantbomb_url>		<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/13129-1.jpg</boxart1>		<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/7751-yoshi-game-boy-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>		<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57409-yoshi-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart3>		<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/170585-yoshi-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart4>		<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202439-yoshi-game-boy-media.jpg</boxart5>		<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/150296-yoshi-game-boy-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>		<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/150297-yoshi-game-boy-screenshot-1-player-game-settings.jpg</snapshot2>		<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/150298-yoshi-game-boy-screenshot-first-level-in-progress.jpg</snapshot3>		<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/d/2/gfs_2884_1_1.jpg</snapshot4>		<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/1/6/gfs_28977_1_1.jpg</snapshot5>		<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/6/9/gfs_68768_1_1.jpg</snapshot6>		<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/4/f/gfs_2884_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>		<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/8/b/gfs_28977_2_1.jpg</snapshot8>		<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/5/b/gfs_28977_2_2.jpg</snapshot9>		<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/e/b/gfs_28977_2_3.jpg</snapshot10>	</game>	<game name="Yoshi no Cookie (Japan)">		<description>Yoshi no Cookie (Japan)</description>		<rom crc="A37255FE" name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy.zip/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%2FYoshi%20no%20Cookie%20%28Japan%29.zip" sha1="3B19C51B4E7E7275265B90E991FAF6CF64A8085A" size="62759" />		<title_clean>Yoshi no Cookie</title_clean>		<plot>Cookie chaos for Mario and Yoshi!

Initially developed by  Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by  Nintendo, the game has been released in a variety of forms and versions since its original release. The ports of the game include the  Game Boy version (which changes little from the NES version), a  SNES version (which reskinned the game to reference  Super Mario World more frequently), and inclusion in a Japan-only compilation for the  GameCube titled Nintendo Puzzle Collection.[CR]The game included on Nintendo Puzzle Collection is technically an enhanced port of Yoshi's Cookie. There are added things, however, such as upgraded graphics and sound. Other than that, the game is completely identical to the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is made up of a square grid, broken up into 25 to 49 sections (5 x 5 or 7 x 7) depending on the version. Cookies of various decorations fill in the entire grid. The player manipulates entire rows either horizontally or vertically to try to match cookies that are alike. Once a row is filled with cookies of the same design, their point count increases by one and the row is wiped off of the screen.[CR]The multiplayer portion of this game has two of the cookie grids side by side, with a different player controlling each grid while different power-ups cycle on the screen.

The first four stages can be tackled in any order, though the final stage only becomes available after the previous four are complete.[CR]Zen can attack enemies with his energy staff. He has a basic attack, or can charge up his staff for a stronger attack.

The Sega Saturn is the only exception: the Saturn release was exclusive to Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Zoop's main title screen.[CR]In Zoop players control a small ship that is confined to a small box in the middle of the screen, around the box enemies of various colors try to invade the box. The player's job is to use their ship to shoot like-colored enemies, if players shoot an enemy of a different color, the ship's color changes. The challenge is to swap colors with the right enemies in order to stop all of the approaching enemies. If one of the enemies get's in the ship's box, it's game over.[CR]Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward.
